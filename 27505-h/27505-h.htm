<p>FOREWORD</p>
</div>

<p>A reach of level prairie bounded only by the edge
of the world&mdash;misty ravelings of heliotrope and
amber, covered only by the arch of heaven&mdash;blue, beautiful
and pitiless in its far fathomless spaces. To the southwest a
triple fold of deeper purple on the horizon line&mdash;mere hint
of commanding headlands thitherward. Across the face of
the prairie streams wandering through shallow clefts, aimlessly,
somewhere toward the southeast; their course
secured by gentle swells breaking into sheer low bluffs on
the side next to the water, or by groups of cottonwood
trees and wild plum bushes along their right of way. And
farther off the brown indefinite shadowings of half-tamed
sand dunes. Aside from these things, a featureless landscape&mdash;just
grassy ground down here and blue cloud-splashed
sky up there.</p>
<p>The last Indian trail had disappeared. The hoofprints
of cavalry horses had faded away. The price had been
paid for the prairie&mdash;the costly measure of death and daring.
But the prairie itself, in its loneliness and loveliness,
was still unsubdued. Through the fury of the winter&#8217;s
blizzard, the glory of the springtime, the brown wastes of
burning midsummer, the long autumn, with its soft sweet
air, its opal skies, and the land a dream of splendor which
the far mirage reflects and the wide horizon frames in a
curtain of exquisite amethyst&mdash;through none of these was
the prairie subdued. Only to the coming of that king
whose scepter is the hoe, did soul of the soil awake to
life and promise. To him the wilderness gave up everything
except its beauty and the sweep of the freedom-breathing
winds that still inspire it.</p>

<p>The old Aydelot farm reached quite down to the little
village of Cloverdale, from which it was separated
by Clover Creek. But the Aydelot farmhouse stood a
good half-mile away up the National pike road toward the
Virginia state line. The farm consisted of two long narrow
strips of ground, bordering the road on either side
and walled about by forests hiding stagnant marshes in
their black-shadowed depths. Francis Aydelot had taken
up the land from the government before the townsite was
thought of. Farming was not to his liking and his house
had been an inn, doing a thriving business with travelers
going out along that great National highway in ante-railway
days. But when the village took root and grew
into a little town, the village tavern absorbed the revenue
from the traveling public, and Francis Aydelot had, perforce,
to put his own hands to the plow and earn a living
from the land. It was never a labor of love with him,
however, and although he grew well-to-do in the tilling, he
resented the touch of the soil as something degrading.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span></p>
<p>Cloverdale did not grow toward him, because, out of
prejudice at its being, he would not sell one foot of his
ground for town lot purposes. Nevertheless, since he was
upright in all his dealings, the villagers grew proud of
him, deferred to his judgment, quoted his opinions, and
rated him generally the biggest asset of the community,
with one exception. That exception was young Asher
Aydelot, a pink-cheeked, gray-eyed boy, only son of the
House of Aydelot and heir to all the long narrow acres
from the wooded crest on the east to the clear waters of
Clover Creek on the west. He was heir to more than these,
however, if the heritage of ancestry counts for anything.</p>
<p>Jean Aydelot, the first of the name in America, driven
from France by his family on account of his Huguenot
beliefs, had settled in Virginia. He had quickly grasped
the American ideals of freedom, the while he affiliated easily
with the exclusive English Cavaliers. Something of the
wanderlust in his blood, however, kept him from rooting
too firmly at once. It happened that when a band of
Quaker exiles had sought refuge in Virginia and was
about to be driven out by the autocratic Cavaliers, young
Aydelot, out of love for a Quaker girl, had championed
their cause vehemently. And he was so influential in the
settlement that he might have succeeded, but for one
family&mdash;the wealthy and aristocratic Thaines. Through
the son of this family the final expulsion of these Quakers
was accomplished. The woman in the case was Mercy
Pennington, a pretty Quakeress with whom young Jerome
Thaine fell in love, promising protection to all her people
in return for her hand. When she refused his offer, the
Thaines carried the day, and the Quakers again became
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
exiles. Jean Aydelot followed them to Pennsylvania and
married Mercy Pennington, who was promptly disowned
by the Quaker Church for this marriage to one outside its
membership.</p>
<p>In spite of all this heresy, however, the Aydelots became
one of the leading families in the development of the
colonies. Their descendants fell heir to the traits of their
French-English forbears: freedom of belief, courage to
follow a cause, a touch of the wanderlust, the mercurial
French mind, and the steady poise of the followers of the
Inward Light. A trace of bitterness had come down the
years, however, with the family history; a feud-like resentment
against the family of Jerome Thaine of Virginia.</p>
<p>Francis Aydelot had crossed the Alleghanies and settled
in Ohio in frontier days. Here his life, like his narrow,
woods-bound farm, was clean and open but narrowed by
surroundings and lack of opportunity. What had made
for freedom and reform in his ancestors, in him became
prejudice and stubborn will. Mrs. Aydelot was a broad-minded
woman. Something of vision was in her clear
gray eyes. Love of beauty, respect for learning, and an
almost statesman-like grasp of civic duty and the trend of
national progress were hers, too.</p>
<p>From such ancestry came Asher Aydelot, the healthiest,
happiest country boy that ever waked the echoes of the old
Ohio woodlands, or dared the currents of her mad little
rivers, or whistled fearlessly as he scampered down the
dusty pike road in the soft black summer nights.</p>
<p>Asher was just fifteen when the Civil War swept the
nation off its feet. The Quaker spirit of Mercy Pennington
made fighting repulsive to his father, but in Asher the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span>
old Huguenot courage of Jean Aydelot blazed forth,
together with the rash partisanship of a young hot-blood
whose life has been hemmed in too narrowly by forest walls.
Almost before Cloverdale knew there was a war, the Third
Ohio Regiment was on its way to the front. Among its
bearded men was one beardless youth, a round-faced drummer
boy of fifteen, the only child of the big farmhouse beside
the National road. In company with him was his boyhood
chum, Jim Shirley, son of the Cloverdale tavern keeper.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>An April sun was slipping behind the treetops, and the
twilight mists were already rising above the creek. Francis
Aydelot and his wife sat on the veranda watching Asher
in the glory of a military suit and brass buttons coming up
the pike with springing step.</p>
<p>&#8220;How strong he is! I&#8217;m glad he is at home again,&#8221;
the mother was saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;s here to stay at last. I have his plans all settled,&#8221;
Francis Aydelot declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Francis, a man must make some plans for himself.
Asher may not agree,&#8221; Mrs. Aydelot spoke earnestly.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can our boy know as well as his father does what
is best for him? He must agree, that&#8217;s all. We have gone
over this matter often enough together. I won&#8217;t have any
Jim Shirley in my family. He&#8217;s gone away and nobody
knows where he is, just when his father needs him to take
the care of the tavern off his hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What made Jim go away from Cloverdale?&#8221; Mrs.
Aydelot asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody seems to know exactly. He left just before
his brother, Tank, married that Leigh girl up the Clover
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span>
valley somewhere. But everything&#8217;s settled for Asher. He
will be marrying one of the Cloverdale girls pretty soon
and stay right here in town. We&#8217;ll take it up with him
now. There&#8217;s no use waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And yet I wish we might wait till he speaks of it himself.
Remember, he&#8217;s been doing his own thinking in the
time he&#8217;s been away,&#8221; the mother insisted.</p>
<p>Just then, Asher reached the corner of the door yard.
Catching sight of the two, he put his hands on the top of
the paling fence, leaped lightly over it, and came across
to the veranda, where he sat down on the top step.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just getting in from town? The place hasn&#8217;t changed
much, has it?&#8221; the father declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not much,&#8221; Asher replied absently, looking out
with unseeing eyes at the lengthening woodland shadows,
&#8220;a church or two more, some brick sidewalk, and a few
stores and homes&mdash;just added on, not improved. I miss
Jim Shirley everywhere. The older folks seem the same,
but some of the girls are pushing baby-carriages and the
boys are getting round-shouldered and droopy-jawed.&#8221;</p>
<p>He drew himself up with military steadiness as he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you are glad to settle down anyhow,&#8221; his father
responded. &#8220;The old French spirit of roving and adventure
has had its day with you, and now you will begin
your life work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m done with fighting.&#8221; Asher&#8217;s lips tightened.
&#8220;But what do you call my life work, father?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the eighth April after the opening of the Civil
War. Asher had just come home from two years of army
service on the western plains. Few changes had come to
the little community; but to the young man, who eight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
springtimes ago had gone out as a pink-cheeked drummer
boy, the years had been full of changes. He was now
twenty-three, straight as an Indian, lean and muscular as
a veteran soldier. The fair, round cheeks of boyhood were
brown and tinged with red-blooded health. There was
something resolute and patient in the clear gray eyes, as
if the mother&#8217;s own far vision had crept into them. But
the ready smile that had made the Cloverdale community
love the boy broke as quickly now on the man&#8217;s face, giving
promise that his saving sense of humor and his good
nature would be factors to reckon with in every combat.</p>
<p>Asher had staid in the ranks till the end of the war, had
been wounded, captured, and imprisoned; had fought
through a hospital fever and narrowly escaped death in the
front of many battle lines. But he did not ask for a furlough,
nor account his duty done till the war was ended.
Just before that time, when he was sick in a Southern
prison, a rebel girl had walked into his life to stay forever.
With his chum, Jim Shirley, he had chafed through two
years in a little eastern college, the while bigger things
seemed calling him to action. At the end of the second
year, he broke away, and joining the regular army, began
the hazardous life of a Plains scout.</p>
<p>Two years of fighting a foe from every way the winds
blow, cold and hunger, storms and floods and desert heat,
poisonous reptiles, poisoned arrows of Indians, and the
deadly Asiatic cholera; sometimes with brave comrades,
sometimes with brutal cowards, sometimes on scout duty,
utterly and awfully alone; over miles on endless miles of
grassy level prairies, among cruel canyons, in dreary sand
lands where men die of thirst, monotonous and maddening
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
in their barren, eternal sameness; and sometimes, between
sunrises of superb grandeur, and sunsets of sublime glory,
over a land of exquisite virgin loveliness&mdash;it is small wonder
that the ruddy cheeks were bronze as an Indian&#8217;s, that
the roundness of boyhood had given place to the muscular
strength of manhood, that the gray eyes should hold something
of patience and endurance and of a vision larger
than the Cloverdale neighborhood might understand.</p>
<p>When Asher had asked, &#8220;What do you call my life
work, Father?&#8221; something impenetrable was in his direct
gaze.</p>
<p>Francis Aydelot deliberated before replying. Then the
decisive tone and firm set of the mouth told what resistance
to his will might cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may not seem quite homelike at first, but you will
soon find a wife and that always settles a man. I can trust
you to pick the best there is here. As to your work, it
must be something fit for a gentleman, and that&#8217;s not
grubbing in the ground. Of course, this is Aydelot soil.
It couldn&#8217;t belong to anybody else. I never would sell a
foot of it to Cloverdale to let the town build this way. I&#8217;d
as soon sell to a Thaine from Virginia as I&#8217;d sell to that
town.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waved a hand toward the fields shut in by heavy
woodlands, where the shadows were already black. After
a moment he continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is settled for you, Asher. I&#8217;ve been pretty
careful and lucky, too, in some ways. The men who didn&#8217;t
go to war had the big chances at money making, you know.
While you were off fighting, I was improving the time here.
I&#8217;ve done it fairly, though. I never dodged a law in my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
life, nor met a man into whose eyes I couldn&#8217;t look
squarely.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he spoke, the blood left Asher&#8217;s cheeks and his face
grew gray under the tan.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, do you think a man who fights for his country
is to be accounted below the man who stays at home and
makes money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he certainly can do more for his children than
some of those who went to this war can do for their
fathers,&#8221; Francis Aydelot declared. &#8220;Suppose I was helpless
and poor now, what could you do for me?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no attempt at reply, and the father went on:
&#8220;I have prepared your work for you. You must begin it
at once. Years ago Cloverdale set up a hotel, a poor
enough tavern even for those days, but it robbed me of the
patronage this house had before that time, and I had to
go to farming. Every kind of drudgery I&#8217;ve had to do
here. Cutting down forests, and draining swamps is a
back-breaking business. I never could forgive the founders
for stopping by Clover Creek, when they might have gone
twenty miles further on where a town was needed and left
me here. But that&#8217;s all past now. I&#8217;ve improved the time.
I have a good share of stock in the bank and I own the
only hotel in Cloverdale. I closed with Shirley as soon
as I heard you were coming home. Shirley&#8217;s getting old,
and since Jim has gone there&#8217;s no one to help him and
take his place later, so he sold at a very good figure. He
had to sell for some reason, I believe. The Shirleys are
having some family trouble that I don&#8217;t understand nor
care about. You&#8217;ve always been a sort of idol in the town
anyhow. Now that you are to go into the Shirley House
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
as proprietor I suppose Cloverdale will take it as a dispensation
of Providence in their favor, and you can live
like a gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, father, I&#8217;ve always liked the country best. Don&#8217;t
you remember how Jim Shirley was always out here instead
of my going down town when we were boys?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are only a boy, now, Asher, and this is all I&#8217;ll hear
to your doing. You ought to be thankful for having such
a chance open to you. I have leased the farm for five
years and you don&#8217;t want to be a hired man at twenty dollars
a month, I reckon. Of course, the farm will be yours
some day, unless you take a notion to run off to Virginia
and marry a Thaine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The last words were said jokingly, but Asher&#8217;s mother
saw a sudden hardening of the lines of his face as he sat
looking out at the darkening landscape.</p>
<p>There was only a faint glow in the west now. The fields
toward Cloverdale were wrapped in twilight shadows.
Behind the eastern treetops the red disk of the rising moon
was half revealed. Asher Aydelot waited long before he
spoke. At length, he turned toward his father with a certain
stiffening of his form, and each felt a space widening
gulf-wise between them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stayed at home and grew rich, Father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221;</p>
<p>The father&#8217;s voice cut like a steel edge. He saw only
opposition to his will here, but the mother forecasted the
end from that moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Father, war gives us to see bigger things than hatred
between two sections of the country. There is education in
it, too. That is a part of the compensation. Once, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
our regiment was captured and starving, the Fifty-fourth
Virginia boys saved our lives by feeding us the best supper
I ever tasted. And a Rebel girl&mdash;&#8221; he broke off suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what of all this? What are you trying to say?&#8221;
queried the older man.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m trying to show you that I cannot sit down here
in the Shirley House and play mine host any more than I
could&mdash;&#8221; hesitatingly&mdash;&#8220;marry a Cloverdale girl on
demand. No Cloverdale girl would have me so. I&#8217;ve seen
too much of the country for such a position, Father. Let
the men who staid at home do the little jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had not meant to say all this, but the stretch of
boundless green prairies was before his eyes, the memory
of heroic action where men utterly forget themselves was
in his mind, making life in that little Ohio settlement seem
only a boy&#8217;s pastime, to be put away with other childish
things. While night and day, in the battle clamor, in the
little college class room, on boundless prairie billows, among
lonely sand dunes&mdash;everywhere, he carried the memory of
the gentle touch of the hand of a rebel girl, who had visited
him when he was sick and in prison. And withal, he
resented dictation, as all the Aydelots and Penningtons
before him had done.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you propose to do?&#8221; his father asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet what I can do. I only know what I
cannot do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is&mdash;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what I have said. I cannot be a tavern keeper
here the rest of my days with nothing to do half of the
time except to watch the men pitch horseshoes behind the
blacksmith shop, and listen to the flies buzz in the windows
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
on summer afternoons; and everything else so quiet and
dead you don&#8217;t know whether you are on the street or in
the graveyard. If you&#8217;d ever crossed the Mississippi River
you&#8217;d understand why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I haven&#8217;t, and I don&#8217;t understand. But the only
way to stop this roving is to make a home of your own.
Will you tell me how you expect to support a Cloverdale
girl when you marry one?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t expect to marry one.&#8221; The smile was winning,
but the son&#8217;s voice sounded dangerously like the father&#8217;s.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Because when I marry it will be to a southern girl&mdash;&#8221;
Asher hesitated a moment. When he went on, his voice was
not as son to father, but as man to man.</p>
<p>&#8220;It all happened down in Virginia, when I was wounded
and in prison. This little girl took care of me. Only a
soldier really knows what a woman&#8217;s hand means in sickness.
But she did more. She risked everything, even her
life, to get letters through the lines to you and to get
me exchanged. I shiver yet when I think of her, disguised
as a man in soldier&#8217;s clothes, taking the chance
she did for me. And, well, I left my heart down there.
That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you ever told us this before, Asher?&#8221;
his father asked.</p>
<p>Asher stood up where the white moonlight fell full on
his face. Somehow the old Huguenot defiance and the old
Quaker endurance of his ancestors seemed all expressed
in him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t twenty-one, then, and I have nothing yet to
offer a girl by way of support,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Asher!&#8221; Mrs. Aydelot exclaimed, &#8220;you have
everything here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet, mother,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;And I haven&#8217;t told
you because her name is Virginia Thaine, and she is a
descendant of Jerome Thaine. Are the Aydelots big
enough to bury old hates?&#8221;</p>
<p>Francis Aydelot sat moveless as a statue. When at
length he spoke, there was no misunderstanding his meaning.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have no means by which to earn a living. You
will go down to town and take charge of the Shirley House
at once, or go to work as a hired hand here. But remember
this: from the day you marry a Thaine of Virginia
you are no longer my son. Family ties, family honor,
respect for your forefathers forbid it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose without more words, and went into the house.</p>
<p>Then came the mother&#8217;s part.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Asher,&#8221; she said, and Asher dropped to his
place on the step.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t seem to see life through the same spectacles,&#8221;
he said calmly. &#8220;Am I wrong, mother? Nobody can
choose my life for me, nor my wife, either. Didn&#8217;t old
grandfather, Jean Aydelot, leave his home in France, and
didn&#8217;t grandmother, Mercy Pennington, marry to suit her
own choice?&#8221;</p>
<p>Even in the shadow, his mother noted the patient expression
of the gray eyes looking up at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asher, it is Aydelot tradition to be determined and self-willed,
and the bitterness against Jerome Thaine and his
descendants has never left the blood&mdash;till now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She stroked his hair lovingwise, as mothers will ever do.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you suppose father will ever change?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he will. We have talked of this many
times, and he will listen to nothing else. He grows more
set in his notions as we all do with years, unless&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t, mother. Unless what?&#8221; Asher
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless we think broadly as the years broaden out
toward old age. But, Asher, what are your plans?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I have none yet. You know I was a farmer
boy until I was fifteen, a soldier boy till I was nineteen, a
college student for two years, and a Plains scout for two
years more. Tell me, mother, what does all this fit me
for? Not for a tavern in a town of less than a thousand
people.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat waiting, his elbow resting on his knee, his chin
supported by his closed hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asher, when you left school and went out West, I foresaw
what has happened tonight,&#8221; Mrs. Aydelot began. &#8220;I
tried to prepare your father for it, but he would not listen,
would not understand. He doesn&#8217;t yet. He never will.
But I do. You will not stay in Ohio always, because you
do not fit in here now. Newer states keep calling you westward,
westward. This was frontier when we came here in
the thirties; we belong here. But, sooner or later, you will
put your life into the building of the West. Something&mdash;the
War or the Plains, or may be this Virginia
Thaine, has left you too big for prejudice. You will
go sometime where there is room to think and live as you
believe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mother, may I go? I dream of it night and day. I&#8217;m
so cramped here. The woods are in my way. I can&#8217;t see a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
mile. I want to see to the edge of the world, as I can on
the prairies. A man can win a kingdom out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was facing her now, his whole countenance aglow
with bright anticipation.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is only one way to win that kingdom,&#8221; Mrs.
Aydelot declared. &#8220;The man who takes hold of the plow-handles
is the man who will really conquer the prairies.
His scepter is not the rifle, but the hoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>For all his life, Asher Aydelot never forgot his mother&#8217;s
face, nor the sound of her low prophetic words on that
moonlit night on the shadowy veranda of his childhood
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, mother. I don&#8217;t want to fight any more.
It must be the soil that is calling me back to the West, the
big, big West! And I mean to go when the time comes.
I hope it will come soon, and I know you will give me your
blessing then.&#8221;</p>
<p>His mother&#8217;s hands were pressed lovingly upon his forehead,
as he leaned against her knee.</p>
<p>&#8220;My blessing, and more than mine. The blessing of
Moses to Asher of old, as well. &#8216;Thy shoes shall be iron
and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be. The
eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting
arms.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>She bent over her boy, and pushing back the hair from
his forehead, she kissed it reverently, nor dreamed in how
many a bitter strife would the memory of this sacred hour
come back to him, with the blessed note of victory.</p>
<p>The next morning Asher put on his working clothes and
began the life of a hired man on his father&#8217;s farm. The
summer was long and hot, and in the late August the dread
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
typhoid malaria swept up from the woods marshes. It was
of virulent form and soon had its way with Asher&#8217;s father
and mother.</p>
<p>When the will of Francis Aydelot was read in court, the
inexorable will of a stubborn man, it declared that the
Cloverdale Hotel, the bank stock, and the farm with all the
appurtenances thereunto pertaining, should descend to
Asher Aydelot, provided he should remain a resident of
Ohio and should never be united in marriage to any
descendant of Jerome Thaine of the State of Virginia.
Failing in this, all the property, except a few hundred
dollars in cash, should descend to one Jane Aydelot, of
Philadelphia, and her heirs and assigns forever; provided
these heirs were not the children of Virginia Thaine of the
state of Virginia.</p>
<p>On the same day, Asher wrote to one Jane Aydelot, of
Philadelphia, to come to Ohio and take possession of her
property. Then he carefully sodded the two mounds in
the graveyard, and planted old-fashioned sweet pinks upon
them, and bidding good-by to the home of his boyhood, he
turned his face hopefully to the West.</p>

<p>The trail had left the woodland far to the eastward,
and wound its way over broad prairie billows, past
bluffy-banked streams, along crests of low watersheds,
until at last it slid down into an open endlessness of the
Lord&#8217;s earth&mdash;just a vasty bigness of landstuff seemingly
left over when geography-making was done. It was
untamed stuff, too, whereon one man&#8217;s marking was like to
the track of foam in the wake of one ship in mid-ocean.
Upon its face lay the trail, broad and barren of growth as
the dusty old National pike road making its way across
uplands and valleys of Ohio. But this was the only likeness.
The pike was a gravel-built, upgraded highway, bordered
by little rail-fenced fields and deep forests hiding malarial
marshes in the lower places.</p>
<p>This trail, flat along the ungraded ground, tended in the
direction of least resistance, generally toward the southwest.
It was bounded by absence of landmarks, boulder or
tree or cliff. Along either side of it was a fringe of spindling
sunflower stalks, with their blooms of gold marking
two gleaming threads across the plains far toward the
misty nothingness of the western horizon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span></p>
<p>The mid-September day had been intensely hot, but the
light air was beginning to flow a bit refreshingly out of
the sky. A gray cloud-wave, creeping tide-like up from the
southwest, was tempering the afternoon glare. In all the
landscape the only object to hold the eye was a prairie
schooner drawn by a team of hard-mouthed little Indian
ponies, and followed by a free-limbed black mare of the
Kentucky blue blood.</p>
<p>Asher Aydelot sat on the wagon seat holding the reins.
Beside him was his wife, a young, girlish-looking woman
with large dark eyes, abundant dark hair, a straight, aristocratic
nose, and well-formed mouth and chin.</p>
<p>The two, coming in from the East on the evening before,
had reached the end of the stage line, where Asher&#8217;s team
and wagon was waiting for them.</p>
<p>The outfit moved slowly. It had left Carey&#8217;s Crossing
at early dawn and had put twenty-five miles between itself
and that last outpost of civilization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you let the horses trot down this hill slope,
Asher?&#8221; The woman&#8217;s voice had the soft accent of the
South.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you tired, Virgie?&#8221; Asher Aydelot looked earnestly
down at his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit!&#8221; The bright smile and vigorous lift of the
shoulders were assuring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we won&#8217;t hurry. We have several miles to go
yet. It is a long day&#8217;s run from Carey&#8217;s to our claim.
Wolf County is almost like a state. The Crossing hopes to
become the county seat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do they call that place Carey&#8217;s Crossing?&#8221; Mrs.
Aydelot asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a trading post once where the north and south
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
trail crossed the main trail. Later it was a rallying place
for cavalry. Now it&#8217;s our postoffice,&#8221; Asher explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean, why call it Carey? I knew Careys back in
Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is named for a young doctor, the only one in ten
thousand miles, so far as I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And his family?&#8221; Virginia asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a bachelor, I believe. By the way, we aren&#8217;t going
down hill. We are on level ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mrs. Aydelot leaned out beyond the wagon bows to take
in the trail behind them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, we are right in a big saucer. All the land
slopes to the center down there before us. Can&#8217;t you
see it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;ve seen it too often. It is just a trick of the
plains&mdash;one of the many tricks for the eye out here. Look
at the sunflowers, Virgie. Don&#8217;t you love them?&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia Aydelot nestled close to her husband&#8217;s side and
put one hand on his. It was a little hand, white and soft,
the hand of a lady born of generations of gentility. The
hand it rested on was big and hard and brown and very
strong looking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always loved them since the day you sent me the
little one in a letter,&#8221; she said in a low voice, as if some one
might overhear. &#8220;I thought you had forgotten me and
the old war days. I wasn&#8217;t very happy then.&#8221; There was
a quiver of the lip that hinted at the memory of intense
sorrow. &#8220;I had gone up to the spring in that cool little
glen in the mountain behind our home, you know, when a
neighbor&#8217;s servant boy, Bo Peep, Boanerges Peeperville, he
named himself, came grinning round a big rock ledge with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
your letter. Just a crushed little sunflower and a sticky old
card, the deuce of hearts. I knew it was from you, and I
loved the sunflower for telling me so. Were you near here
then? This land looks so peaceful and beautiful to me,
and homelike somehow, as if we should find some neighbors
just over the hill that you say isn&#8217;t there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither the hill nor the neighbors, yet, although settlers
will be coming soon. We won&#8217;t be lonesome very long,
I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asher shifted the reins to his other hand and held the
little white fingers close.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t anywhere near here. It was away off in the
southwest corner of&mdash;nowhere. I was going to say a
shorter word, for that&#8217;s where we were. I took that card
out of an old deck from the man nearest me. The
Comanches had fixed him, so he didn&#8217;t need it in his game
any more. There were only two of us left, a big half-breed
Cheyenne scout and myself. I picked the sunflower from
the only stalk within a hundred miles of there. I guess it
grew so far from everything just for me that day. Weak
as I was, I&#8217;ll never forget how hopefully it seemed to look
at me. The envelope was one mother had sent me, you
remember. I told the Cheyenne how to start it to you from
the fort. He left me there, wounded and alone&mdash;&#8217;twas all
he could do&mdash;while he went for help about a thousand miles
away it must have seemed, even to an Indian. I thought it
was my last message to you, dearie, for I never expected
to be found alive; but I was, and when you wrote back,
sending your letter to &#8217;The Sign of the Sunflower,&#8217;
Oh, little girl, the old trail blossom was glorified for me
forever.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span></p>
<p>He broke off so suddenly that his wife looked up
inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of the cool spring and the rocks, and
that shady glen, and the mountains, and the trees, and the
well-kept mansion houses, and servants like Bo Peep to
fetch and carry&mdash;and here&mdash;Virginia, why did you let
me persuade you away from them? Everything was made
ready for you there. The Lord didn&#8217;t do anything for this
country but go off and leave it to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to us. Here is the sunflower and the new home
in the new West and Asher Aydelot. And underfoot is the
prairie sod that is ours, and overhead is heaven that kept
watch over you for me, and over both of us for this. And
I persuaded you to bring me here because I wanted to be
with you always.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You can face it all for me?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;With you, you mean. Yes, for we&#8217;ll stop at &#8216;The Sign
of the Sunflower&#8217; so long as we both shall live. How beautiful
they are, these endless bands of gold, drawing us on
and on across the plains. Asher, you forget that Virginia
is not as it was before the war. But we did keep inherited
pride in the Thaine family, and the will to do as we pleased.
You see what has pleased me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And it shall please me to make such a fortune out of
this ground, and build such a home for you that by and by
you will forget you ever were without the comforts you are
giving up now,&#8221; Asher declared, looking equal to the task.
&#8220;Virgie,&#8221; he added presently, &#8220;on the night my mother
told me to come out West she gave me her blessing, and the
blessing of the old Bible Asher also&mdash;&#8216;Thy shoes shall be
iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall thy strength be.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
I believe the blessing will stay with us; that the Eternal
God will be our refuge in this new West and new home-building.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode awhile in silence. Then Asher said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look yonder, Virginia, south of the trail. Just a faint
yellow line.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it another trail, or are you lost and beginning to see
things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m found,&#8221; Asher replied. &#8220;We scattered those
seeds ourselves; did it on Sundays when I was living on my
claim, waiting till I could go back and bring you here. We
blazed the way, marked it with gold, I&#8217;d better say; a line
clear to Grass River. It leaves the real Sunflower Trail
right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who were <i>we</i> in this planting?&#8221; Virginia asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, me and my first wife, Jim Shirley, and his shepherd
dog, Pilot. Jim and I have done several things together
besides that. We were boys together back in Cloverdale.
We went to the war together to fight you obstreperous
Rebels.&#8221; There was a twinkle in Asher&#8217;s eyes now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but in the end who really won?&#8221; Virginia asked
demurely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did, of course&mdash;in my case. Jim went back to
Cloverdale for awhile. Then he came out here. He&#8217;s a fine
fellow. Plants a few more seeds by the wayside than is
good for him, maybe, but a friend to the last rollcall. He
was quite a ladies&#8217; man once, and nobody knows but himself
how much he would have loved a home. He has something
of a story back of his coming West, but we never speak
of that. He&#8217;s our only neighbor now.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was twilight when Asher and his wife slipped down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
over a low swell and reached their home. The afterglow
of sunset was gorgeous in the west. The gray cloud-tide,
now a purple sea, was rifted by billows of flame. Level
mist-folds of pale violet lay along the prairie distances. In
the southwest the horizon line was broken by a triple fold
of deepest blue-black tones, the mark of headlands somewhere.
Across the landscape a grassy outline marked the
course of a stream that wandered dimly toward the darkening
night shadows. The subdued tones of evening held
all the scene, save where a group of tall sunflowers stood
up to catch the last light of day full on their golden shields.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are here at last, Mrs. Aydelot. Welcome to our
neighborhood!&#8221; Asher said bravely as the team halted.</p>
<p>Virginia sat still on the wagon seat, taking in the view
of sunset sky and twilight prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is our home,&#8221; she murmured. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad we are
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you are glad. I hope I haven&#8217;t misrepresented
it to you,&#8221; her husband responded, turning away
that he might not see her face just then.</p>
<p>It was a strange place to call home, especially to one
whose years had been spent mainly in the pretty mountain-walled
Virginia valleys where cool brooks babbled over
pebbly beds or splashed down in crystal waterfalls; whose
childhood home had been an old colonial house with driveways,
and pillared verandas, and jessamine-wreathed windows;
with soft carpets and cushioned chairs, and candelabra
whose glittering pendants reflected the light in prismatic
tintings; and everywhere the lazy ease of idle servants
and unhurried lives.</p>
<p>The little sod house, nestled among sheltering sunflowers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
stood on a slight rise of ground. It contained one room
with two windows, one looking to the east and the other to
the west, and a single door opening on the south. Above
this door was a smooth pine board bearing the inscription,
&#8220;Sunflower Inn,&#8221; stained in rather artistic lettering. A
low roof extending over the doorway gave semblance to a
porch which some scorched vines had vainly tried to decorate.
There was a rude seat made of a goods box beside
the doorway. Behind the house rose the low crest of a
prairie billow, hardly discernible on the level plains. Before
it lay the endless prairie across which ran the now half-dry,
grass-choked stream. A few stunted cottonwood trees followed
its windings, and one little clump of wild plum bushes
bristled in a draw leading down to the shallow place of the
dry watercourse. All else was distance and vastness void
of life and utter loneliness.</p>
<p>Virginia Aydelot looked at the scene before her. Then
she turned to her husband with a smile on her young face,
saying again,</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad I am here.&#8221;</p>
<p>There is one chord that every woman&#8217;s voice touches
some time, no matter what her words may be. As Virginia
spoke, Asher saw again the moonlight on the white pillars
of the south veranda of the old Aydelot farmhouse, and his
mother sitting in the shadows; and again he caught the
tone of her voice saying,</p>
<p>&#8220;Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so
shall thy strength be.&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaped from the wagon seat and put up his arms to
help his wife to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the end of the trail,&#8221; he said gaily. &#8220;We have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
reached the inn with &#8217;The Sign of the Sunflower.&#8217; See the
signboard Jim has put up for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment a big shepherd dog came bounding out
of the weeds by the river and leaped toward them with
joyous yelps; a light shone through the doorway, and a
voice at once deep and pleasant to the ear, called out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here you are, just as supper is ready. Present
me to the bride, Asher, and then I&#8217;ll take the stock off your
hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Aydelot, this is Mr. James Shirley, at present the
leading artistic house decorator as well as corn king of the
Southwest. Allow me, Jim, to present my wife. You two
ought to like each other if each of you can stand me.&#8221;</p>
<p>They shook hands cordially, and each took the other&#8217;s
measure at a glance. What Shirley saw was a small, well-dressed
woman whose charm was a positive force. It was
not merely that she was well-bred and genial of manner,
nor that for many reasons she was pretty and would always
be pretty, even with gray hair and wrinkles. There was
something back of all this; something definite to build on;
a self-reliance and unbreakable determination without the
spirit that antagonizes.</p>
<p>&#8220;A thoroughbred,&#8221; was Shirley&#8217;s mental comment.
&#8220;The manners of a lady and the will of a winner.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Virginia saw was a big, broad-shouldered man,
tanned to the very limit of brownness, painfully clean
shaven, and grotesquely clean in dress; a white shirt, innocent
of bluing in its laundry, a glistening celluloid collar,
a black necktie (the last two features evidently just added
to the toilet, and neither as yet set to their service), dark
pantaloons and freshly blacked shoes. But it was Shirley&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
face that caught Virginia&#8217;s eyes, for even with the tan it
was a handsome face, with regular features, and blue eyes
seeing life deeply rather than broadly. Just a hint of the
artistic, however, took away from rather than added to the
otherwise manly expression. Clearly, Jim Shirley was a
man that men and women, too, must love if they cared for
him at all.. And they couldn&#8217;t help caring for him. He
had too much of the quality of eternal interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to meet you, and I bid you welcome to your
new home, Mrs. Aydelot. The house is in order and supper
is ready. I congratulate you, Asher,&#8221; he said, as he turned
away to take the ponies.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will come in and eat with us,&#8221; Virginia said
cordially.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not tonight. I must put this stock away and hurry
home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asher opened his lips to repeat his wife&#8217;s invitation, but
something in Jim&#8217;s face held the words, so he merely nodded
a good-by as he led his wife into the sod cabin.</p>
<p>Two decades in Kansas saw hundreds of such cabins on
the plains. The walls of this one were nearly two feet thick
and smoothly plastered inside with a gypsum product, giving
an ivory-yellow finish, smooth and hard as bone. There
was no floor but the bare earth into which a nail could
scarcely have been driven. The furniture was meager and
plain. There was only one picture on the wall, the sweet
face of Asher&#8217;s mother. A bookshelf held a Bible with two
or three other volumes, some newspapers and a magazine.
Sundry surprising little devices showed the inventive skill
of the home-builder, but it was all home-made and unpainted.
It must have been the eyes of love that made this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
place seem homelike to these young people whose early
environment had been so vastly different in everything!</p>
<p>Jim Shirley had a supper of fried ham, stewed wild
plums, baked sweet potatoes, and hot coffee, with canned
peaches and some hard little cookies. Surely the Lord
meant men to be the cooks. Society started wrong in the
kitchen, for the average man prepares a better meal with
less of effort and worry than the average or super-average
woman will ever do. It was not the long ride alone, it was
this appetizing food that made that first meal in the sod
mansion one that these two remembered in days of different
fortune. They remembered, too, the bunch of
sunflowers that adorned the table that night. The vase
was the empty peach can wrapped round with a piece of
newspaper.</p>
<p>As they lingered at their meal, Asher glanced through
the little west window and saw Jim Shirley sitting by the
clump of tall sunflowers not far away watching them with
the eager face of a lonely man. A big white-throated
Scotch collie lay beside him, waiting patiently for his
master to start for home.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad Jim has Pilot,&#8221; Asher thought. &#8220;A dog is
better than no company at all. I wish he had a wife. Poor
lonely fellow!&#8221;</p>
<p>Half an hour later the two came outside to the seat by
the doorway. The moon was filling the sky with its radiance.
A chorus of crickets sang joyously in the short
brown grass about the sunflowers. The cottonwoods along
the river course gleamed like alabaster in the white night-splendor,
and the prairie breeze sang its low crooning song
of evening as it flowed gently over the land.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
&#8220;How beautiful the world is,&#8221; Virginia said, as she
caught the full radiance of the light on the prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this beautiful to you, Virgie?&#8221; Asher asked, as he
drew her close to him. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen these plains when they
seemed just plain hell to me, full of every kind of danger:
cholera, poison, cold, hunger, heat, hostile Indian, and awful
loneliness. And yet, the very fascination of the thing
called me back and hardened me to it all. But why? What
is there here on these Kansas prairies to hold me here and
make me want to bring you here, too? Not a feature of
this land is like the home country in Virginia. When the
Lord gave Adam and Eve a tryout in the Garden of Eden,
He gave them everything with which to start the world off
right. Out here we doubt sometimes if there is any God
west of the Missouri River. He didn&#8217;t leave any timber for
shelter, nor wood, nor coal for fuel, nor fruit, nor nuts,
nor roots, nor water for the dry land. All there is of this
piece of the Lord&#8217;s leftovers is just the prairie down here,
and the sky over it. And it&#8217;s so big I wonder sometimes
that there is even enough skystuff to cover it. And yet, it
is beautiful and maddening in its hold, once it gets you.
Why?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe it is the very unconquerableness that cries out
to the love of power in you. Maybe the Lord, who knew
how easily Adam let Eden slip through his fingers, decided
that on the other side of the world He would give a younger
race of men, a fire-tried race in battle, the chance to make
their own Eden. So He left the stuff here for such as you
and me to picture out our own plan and then work to the
pattern. It is the real land of promise. Everything waiting
to be done here.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And there&#8217;s only one way to do it. I am sure of that,&#8221;
Asher replied. &#8220;Armies don&#8217;t win, they terrorize and
destroy. We whipped back the Indians out here; they&#8217;d
come again, if they dared&mdash;but they never will,&#8221; he added
quickly, as he saw his wife&#8217;s face whiten in the moonlight.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a struggle to win the soil, with loneliness and distance
and a few thousand other things to fight, beside. But I
told you all this before I asked you to come out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could have brought some property to you to
help you, Asher, but you know how the Thaine estate was
reduced.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I helped the family to that,&#8221; Asher replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I seem to have helped you to lose the Aydelot
inheritance. We are starting neck and neck out here,&#8221;
Virginia cried, &#8220;and we&#8217;ll win. I can see our plantation&mdash;ranch,
you call it&mdash;now, with groves and a little lake and a
big ranch house, and just acres of wheat and meadows, and
red clover and fine stock and big barns, and you and me, the
peers of a proud countryside when we have really conquered.
&#8216;Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree,
and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree.&#8217;
Isn&#8217;t that the promise?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Virgie, any man could win a kingdom with a wife
like you,&#8221; Asher said tenderly. &#8220;Back in Ohio, when I
grubbed the fence corners, I saw this country night and
day, waiting for us here, and I wondered why the folks
were willing to let the marshes down in the deep woods stagnate
and breed malaria, and then fight the fever with
calomel and quinine every summer, instead of opening the
woodland and draining the swamps. Nevertheless, I&#8217;ve left
enough money in the Cloverdale bank to take you back East
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
and start up some little sort of a living there, if you find
you cannot stay here. I couldn&#8217;t bring you here and burn
all the bridges. All you have to do is to say you want to
go back, and you can go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very good, Asher.&#8221; His wife&#8217;s voice was low
and soft. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t want to go back. Not until we
have failed here. And we shall not fail.&#8221;</p>
<p>And together that night on the far unconquered plains
of Kansas, with the moon shining down upon them, these
two, so full of hope and courage, planned their future.
In the cottonwood trees by the river sands a night bird twittered
sleepily to its mate; the chirp of many crickets in the
short grass below the sunflowers had dwindled to a mere
note at intervals. The soft breeze caressed the two young
faces, then wandered far and far across the lonely land, and
in its long low-breathed call to the night there was a sigh
of sadness.</p>

<p>The next day, and for many days following, the wind
blew; fiercely and unceasingly it blew, carrying every
movable thing before it. Whatever was tending in its direction,
it helped over the ground amazingly. Whatever tried
to move in the face of it had to fight for every inch of the
way. It whipped all the gold from the sunflowers and
threshed them mercilessly about. It snapped the slender
stems of the big, bulgy-headed tumble-weeds and sent them
tumbling over and over, mile after mile, until they were
caught at last in some draw, like helpless living things, to
swell the heap for some prairie fire to feed upon. It lifted
the sand from the river bed and swept it in a prairie simoon
up the slope, wrapping the little cabin in a cloud of gritty
dust. The cottonwoods along the waterway moaned as if
in pain and flung up their white arms in feeble protest.
The wild plum bushes in the draw were almost buried by the
wind-borne drift smothering the narrow crevice, while out
on the plains the long lashing waves of bended grass made
the eyes burn with weariness. And the sun watched it all
with unpitying stare, and the September heat was maddening.
But it was cool inside the cabin. Sod houses shut out
the summer warmth as they shed off the winter&#8217;s cold.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></p>
<p>Virginia Aydelot stood at the west window watching her
husband trying to carry two full pails of water which the
wind seemed bent on blowing broadcast along his path. He
had been plowing a double fireguard around the premises
that morning and his face and clothes were gray with dust.
These days of unceasing winds seemed to Virginia to sap
the last atom of her energy. But she was young and full
of determination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did you put the well so far away, Asher?&#8221; she
asked, as he came inside.</p>
<p>The open door gave the wind a new crevice to fill, and it
slapped wrathfully at the buckets, splashing the contents
on the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to put wells close to the water in this country.
I put this one in before I built here. And if we have a well,
we are so glad we don&#8217;t try to move it. The wind might
find it out and fill it up with sand while we were doing it.
It&#8217;s a jealous wind, this.&#8221; Asher&#8217;s smile lit up his dust-grimed
face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve tried all day to keep the dust off the table. I
meant to do a washing this morning, but how could any
garment stay on the line out there and not be whipped to
shreds?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Virginia, did you ever do a washing before the war?&#8221;
Asher asked through the towel. He was trying to scrub his
face clean with the least possible amount of water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s ancient history. No, nor did I do anything
else. I was too young. Did you ever try to till a whole
section of land back in Ohio before the war?&#8221; Virginia
asked laughingly.</p>
<p>Asher took the towel from his head to look at her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are older than when I first knew you&mdash;the little
lady of the old Jerome Thaine mansion home. But you
haven&#8217;t lost any of that girl&#8217;s charms and you have gained
some new ones with the years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop staring at me and tell me why you didn&#8217;t put the
house down by the well, then,&#8221; Virginia demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did pitch my tent there at first, but it is too near the
river, and several things happened, beside,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a river, really?&#8221; she inquired. &#8220;It looks like
a weed trail.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it is very real when it elects to be. They call it
Grass River because there&#8217;s no grass in it&mdash;only sand and
weeds&mdash;and they call it a river because there is seldom any
water in it. But I&#8217;ve seen such lazy sand-foundered streams
a mile wide and swift as sin. So I take no risk with precious
property, even if I have to tote barrels of water and slop
the parlor rug on windy days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, why didn&#8217;t you put another door in the kitchen
end of the house?&#8221; Virginia questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two reasons, dearie. First, can you keep one door
shut on days like this, even when there is no draught
straight through the house?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, when I put a chair against it, and the table against
the chair, and the bed against the table, and the cookstove
to back up the bed. I see. Shortage of furniture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the effect on this cabin if the wind had a sweep
through two weak places in the wall. I built this thing to
stay till I get ready to go away from it, not for it to go
off and leave me sitting here under the sky some stormy
day. Of course, the real home, the old Colonial style of
house, will stand higher up after awhile, embowered in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
trees, and the wind may play about its vine-covered
verandas, and its stately front columns, but that comes
later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, but what was the second reason for the one
doorway? You said you had two?&#8221; Virginia broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, did I? Well, the other reason is insignificant, but
effective in its way. I had only one door and no lumber
within three hundred miles to make another, and no money
to buy lumber, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You should have married a fortune,&#8221; his wife said
demurely.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did.&#8221; The smile on the lips did not match the look
in the gray eyes. &#8220;My anxiety is that I shall not squander
my possession, now I have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are squandering your dooryard by plowing out
there in front of the house. Isn&#8217;t there ground enough if
the wind will be merciful, not to use up our lawn?&#8221; Virginia
would not be serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have plowed a double fireguard, and I&#8217;ve burned off
the grass between the two to put a wide band of protection
about us. I take no chances. Everything is master in the
wilderness except man. When he has tamed all these things&mdash;prairie
fire, storm and drouth, winds and lonely distances,
why, there isn&#8217;t any more wilderness. But it&#8217;s
tough work getting acclimated to these September breezes,
I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia did not reply at once. All day the scream of
the wind had whipped upon her nerves until she wanted to
scream herself. But it was not in the blood of the breed
to give up easily. Something of the stubborn determination
that had made the oldtime Thaines drive the Quakers
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
from Virginia shone now in the dark eyes of this daughter
of a well-bred house.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all a matter of getting one&#8217;s system and this September
wind system to play the same tune,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virginia, you look just as you did that day when you
said you were going through the Rebel ranks in a man&#8217;s
dress to take a message for me to the Union officer of my
command, although you ran the risk of being shot for a
spy on either side of the lines. When I begged you not to
do it, you only laughed at me. I thought then you were
the bravest girl I ever saw. Now I know it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll try not to get hysterical over the wind out
here. It is a matter of time and adjustment. Let&#8217;s adjust
ourselves to dinner now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond her lightly spoken words Asher caught the
undertone of courage, and he knew that a battle for supremacy
was on, a struggle between physical outcry and
mental poise.</p>
<p>After the meal, he said, &#8220;I must take my plow down to
Shirley&#8217;s this afternoon. His is broken and I can mend it
while he puts in his fireguard with mine. I don&#8217;t mind the
wind, but I won&#8217;t ask you to face it clear down to Shirley&#8217;s
claim. I don&#8217;t like to leave you here, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I would rather stay indoors. What is there to
be afraid of, anyhow?&#8221; Virginia asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing in the world but loneliness,&#8221; her husband
replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I must get used to that, you know. I can begin
now,&#8221; Virginia said lightly.</p>
<p>But for all her courage, she watched him drive away with
a sob in her throat. In all the universe there was nothing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
save a glaring sunlight and an endless cringing of yellow,
wind-threshed grass.</p>
<p>Asher Aydelot had come here with half a dozen other
young fellows, all of whom took up claims along Grass
River. Six months later Jim Shirley had come to the
settlement with a like company who extended the free-holdings
until it was seven miles by the winding of the river
from Aydelot&#8217;s claim on the northwest down the river to
Shirley&#8217;s claim on the southeast.</p>
<p>Eighteen months later only two men were left in the
Grass River valley, Aydelot and Shirley. The shorter trail
as the crow flies between their claims was marked by a
golden thread of sunflowers. At the third bend of the winding
stream a gentle ripple of ground rose high enough to
hide the cabin lights from each other that otherwise might
have given a neighborly comfort to the two lone settlers.</p>
<p>Shirley&#8217;s cabin stood on a tiny swell of ground, mark of
a one-time island, set in a wide bend in the river that was
itself a natural fireguard for most of the circle of the
premises.</p>
<p>The house was snug as a squirrel&#8217;s nest. Before it was
a strip of white clover, as green and fresh looking as if it
were on the banks of Clover Creek in Ohio. Above the door
a plain board bore the one word, &#8220;Cloverdale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Shirley stood watching Asher coming down the trail
against the wind, followed by the big shepherd dog, Pilot,
who had bounded off to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello! How did you get away on a day like this?&#8221;
he called, as the team drew near.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you old granny!&#8221; Asher stopped here.</p>
<p>Both men had been on the Kansas plains long enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
not to mind the wind. It flashed into Asher&#8217;s mind that Jim
was hoping to see his wife with him, and he measured anew
the loneliness of the man&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most too rude for ladies just yet, although I didn&#8217;t
like to leave Virginia alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What could possibly harm her? Your fireguard&#8217;s
done, double done; there&#8217;s no water to drown in, no Indian
to frighten, no wild beast to enter, no white man, in God
knows how many hundred miles. Just nothing to be
afraid of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s it&mdash;just nothing. And it&#8217;s enough to make
even a braver woman afraid. It&#8217;s the eternal vast nothingness,
when the very silence cries out at you. It&#8217;s the awful
loneliness of the plains that makes the advance attack in this
fight with the wilderness. Don&#8217;t we both know that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon we do, but we got over it, and so will Mrs.
Aydelot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; Asher inquired eagerly. &#8220;I
believe she could hardly keep back the tears till I got
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why didn&#8217;t you get away sooner? I know she
will get over it, because she&#8217;s as good a woman as we are
men, and we stood for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here&#8217;s your plow. Better get your guard thrown
up. I can smell smoke now. There&#8217;s a prairie fire sweeping
in on this wind somewhere. There&#8217;s a storm brewing,
too. Remember what a fight we had with fire a year
ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>Asher was helping to put Jim&#8217;s team in the harness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you saved your well and a few other little things.
But you&#8217;ve got your grit, you darned Buckeye, to hold on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
and start again from the ashes. And now you have your
wife here. You are lucky,&#8221; Jim declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that broken plow of yours? Is it bolt or weld?
Maybe I can mend it.&#8221; Asher was casting about for tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s bolt. Everything is on the stable shelves,&#8221; Jim
called back against the wind, as he drove the plow deep in
the black soil. &#8220;Be sure you put &#8217;em back when you are
through with &#8217;em, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Jim!&#8221; Asher said to himself with a smile. &#8220;The
artist in him makes him keep the place in order. He&#8217;d stop
to hang up his coat and vest if he had to fight a mad bull.
Poor judgment puts a good many tragedies into lives as
well as stage villain types of crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>And then Asher thought of Virginia, and wondered what
she was doing through the long afternoon. He was whistling
softly with a smile in his eyes as Jim Shirley made
the tenth round of the premises and stopped opposite the
stable door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Asher, come out and see the sky now,&#8221; he called.
&#8220;It&#8217;s prairie fire and equinoctial storm combined.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asher hurried out to see the dull southwest heavens
shutting off the sunlight out of which raged a wind searing
the sky to a dun gray.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stand there staring, you idiot. Why don&#8217;t you
get your plowing done?&#8221; he cried to Shirley.</p>
<p>Shirley began to loose the trace-chain from the plow.</p>
<p>&#8220;That strip is wide enough now,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
got a clover guard, anyhow. I don&#8217;t need to back-fire like
my neighbors do.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Asher untied his ponies and climbed into the wagon,
Jim held their reins.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Stop a minute. Let a single man offer you a word of
advice, will you?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I need advice,&#8221; Asher smiled down on Jim&#8217;s
earnest face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then heed it, too. No use to tell you to take care of
your wife. You&#8217;ll do that to a fault. But don&#8217;t make any
mistake about Mrs. Asher Aydelot. She went through
Rebel and Union lines once to save your life. Don&#8217;t doubt
her strength to hold her own here as soon as the first fight
is over. She is like that Kentucky thoroughbred of hers;
she&#8217;s got endurance as well as grace and beauty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bless you, Jim,&#8221; Asher said, as he clasped Shirley&#8217;s
hand. &#8220;I wish you had a wife.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they are something of an anxiety, too. Hustle
home ahead of the storm. I&#8217;ve always wished that bluff
at the deep bend didn&#8217;t hide us from each other&#8217;s sight. I&#8217;d
like to blast it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asher Aydelot hurried northward ahead of the hot winds
and deepening shadows of the coming storm. And all the
time, in spite of Jim&#8217;s comforting words, an anxiety grew
and grew. The miles seemed endless, the heavens darkened,
and the wind suddenly gave a gasp and died away,
leaving a hot, blank stillness everywhere.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Virginia, alone in the cabin, had fallen asleep
from sheer nerve weariness. When she awoke, it was late in
the afternoon. The screaming outside had ceased, but the
whir and whine were still going on, and the blaring light
was toned by the dust-filled air.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was only tired,&#8221; Virginia said to herself. &#8220;Now I
am rested, I don&#8217;t mind the wind.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>She went out to watch the trail for Asher&#8217;s coming. He
was not in sight, so she came inside again, but nothing there
could interest her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go out and wait awhile,&#8221; she thought.</p>
<p>Tying a veil over her head, she shut the cabin door and
sat down outside. The wind died suddenly away, the trail
was lifeless, and all the plain cut by the trail as well. Then
the solitude of the thing took up the flight where the wind
had left off.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I ever stand this,&#8221; Virginia cried, springing
up. &#8220;But Asher stood it before I came, or even promised
to come. No knight of the old chivalry days ever endured
such hardships as the claimholders on these Kansas plains
must endure. But it takes women to make homes. They
can never, never win here without wives. I could go back
to Virginia if I would.&#8221; She shut her teeth tightly, and the
small hands were clenched. &#8220;But I won&#8217;t do it. I&#8217;ll stay
here with Asher Aydelot. Other men and women as eager
as we are will come soon. We can wait, and some day, Oh,
some day, we&#8217;ll not miss what the Thaines lost by the war
and the Aydelots lost by the Thaines, for we&#8217;ll have a
prince&#8217;s holdings on these desolate plains!&#8221;</p>
<p>She stood with her hands clasped looking with far-seeing
dark eyes down the long trail by the dry river bed, like a
goddess of Conquest on a vast untamed prairie.</p>
<p>A sudden sweep of the wind aroused her, and the loneliness
of the plains rose up again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll get Juno and follow the trail till I meet Asher. I
can&#8217;t get lost where there&#8217;s nothing but space,&#8221; she said
aloud, as she hurried to the stable and led out the petted
thoroughbred.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></p>
<p>Horses are very human creatures, responding not only to
the moods of their masters, but to the conditions that give
these moods. The West was no kinder to the eastern-bred
horse than to the eastern-bred man. All day Juno had
plunged about the stable and pawed the hard earth floor in
sheer nervousness. She leaped out of doors now at Virginia&#8217;s
call, as eager for comfort as a homesick child.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll chase off and meet Asher, darling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even the soft voice the mare had heard all her days did
not entirely soothe her. As Virginia mounted the wind flung
shut the stable door with a bang. Juno leaped as from a
gunshot, and dashed away up the river to the northwest.
Her rider tried in vain to change her course and quiet her
spirit. The mare only surged madly forward, as if bent on
outrunning the tantalizing, grinding wind. With the sense
of freedom, and with the boundlessness of the plains, some
old instinct of the unbridled days of by-gone generations
woke to life and power in her, and with the bit between her
teeth, she swept away in unrestrained speed.</p>
<p>Virginia was a skilled horsewoman, and she had no fear
for herself, so she held the reins and kept her place.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can go wherever you can, you foolish Juno,&#8221; she
cried, giving herself up to the exhilarating ride. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
stay together to the end of the race, and we will get it out
of our systems once for all, and come back &#8216;plains-broke.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond a westward sweeping curve of the river&#8217;s course
the chase became a climb up a long slope that grew steeper
and steeper, cutting off the view of the stream. Here
Juno&#8217;s speed slackened, then dropped into a steady canter,
as she listened for a command to turn back.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go on to the edge of that bluff, lady, now we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
are here, and see what is across the river,&#8221; Virginia said.
&#8220;Then we will hurry home to Asher and prairie hay.&#8221;</p>
<p>When they came at last over a rough shale outcrop to
the highest headland, the river bed lay between its base and
a barren waste of sand dunes, with broad grassy regions
beyond them spreading southward. The view from the
bluff&#8217;s top was magnificent. Virginia held Juno to the
place and looked in wonder at the vast southwest on this
strange September afternoon. Across a reach of level
land, miles wide, a prairie fire was sweeping in the majesty
of mastery. The lurid flames leaped skyward, while roll on
surging roll of black smoke-waves, with folds of gray ashes
smothering between, poured out along the horizon. Beyond
the fire was the dark blue storm-cloud, banded across the
front by the hail mark of coppery green.</p>
<p>Virginia sat enchanted by the grandeur of the scene.
The veil had fallen from her head, and with white face and
fascinated eyes, she watched the glowing fury, a graceful
rider on a graceful black horse, on the crest of the lone
headland outlined against the sky.</p>
<p>Suddenly the terror of it broke upon her. She was miles
from the cabin with its double fireguard. Asher had said
such fires could leap rivers. Between her and safety were
many level banks where the sandy stream bed was narrow,
and many grassy stretches where there was no water at all.</p>
<p>Distance, storm wind, fire and hail, all seemed ready to
close down upon her, making her senses reel. One human
being, alone before the wrath of Nature! In all the years
that followed, she never forgot that scene. For in that
moment a whisper came from somewhere out of the void,
&#8220;The Eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
everlasting arms,&#8221; and she clasped her hands in a wordless
prayer.</p>
<p>The wind that had been cruel all day grew suddenly kind.
A dead calm held the air in a hot stillness. Then with a
whip and a whirl, it swung its course about and began to
pour cool and strong out of the northwest.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind is changing,&#8221; Virginia cried, as she felt its
chill and saw the flame and smoke tower upward and bend
back from the way. &#8220;It is blowing the fire to the east, to
the southeast. But, will it catch Asher? Oh, you good
Wind, blow south! blow south!&#8221; she pleaded, as she dashed
down the long slope for the homeward race.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When Asher reached his claim, he looked in vain for
Virginia&#8217;s face as he passed the cabin window. He hurried
the ponies into the corral, and the wagon under the lean-to
beside the stable, half conscious that something was missing
inside. Then he hastened to the cabin, but Virginia was
not there.</p>
<p>&#8220;She may be in the stable.&#8221; He half whispered the
words in his anxiety.</p>
<p>The ponies in the corral were greedily eating their hay,
but the black mare Juno was gone. As Asher turned toward
the house, he caught the low roaring of the tempest and
felt a rush of cool wind from somewhere. A huge storm-wave
of yellow dust was rolling out of the southwest;
beyond it the heavens were copper-green, and back of that,
midnight darkness; while, borne onward by its force, low
waves of prairie fire were swept along the ground.</p>
<p>Down at the third bend of the river where long growths
overhung the stream, the flames crossed easily. Even as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
Asher Aydelot watched the storm cloud, long tongues of
fire came licking up the valley toward him, not a towering
height, but a swift crawling destruction which he looked at
with unseeing eyes, for his only thought was for Virginia.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could I have missed her if she started to meet me?
Yet, where can she be now?&#8221; he groaned.</p>
<p>The hungry flames gnawed vainly about his broad fireguard,
then wavered back and forth along the south prairie,
while he watched them under the fascination the mastery of
the elements can exert. He turned at last from the fire and
storm to see Juno and her rider swinging down the northwest
prairie, keeping close to the river line before the chill
north wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Virgie, Virgie,&#8221; he cried, as she slipped from the
saddle and he caught her in his arms. &#8220;I&#8217;ve lived a hundred
years since I left you this afternoon. What made
you run away?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the joy of her safe return, he forgot the fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, don&#8217;t you see the wind is from the north? And
it is blowing everything south now? I saw it begin away
up the river. Did that guard really keep off that thing I
saw from the high bluff up yonder?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I put it there to do it, and I&#8217;d take the chances. Awful
as it is, it can&#8217;t do anything but burn, and there&#8217;s nothing
here to burn. If it hadn&#8217;t been there, everything would
have been gone and you would have come back to a pile of
ashes if the wind had left a pile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you put your puny hands to the plow handles and
say to that awful fury, &#8216;So far, and no farther. This is my
home.&#8217; You, one little human being!&#8221; Virginia&#8217;s eyes
were glowing with wonder at the miracle.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, with my puny hands. Me&mdash;a little man,&#8221; Asher
smiled quizzically, as he spread his broad brown hands before
his face and drew himself up to his full six feet of height.
&#8220;Only I say, &#8217;our home.&#8217; But I was so scared about you, I
forgot to notice the change in the wind. The fire is chasing
to the south, and the hailstorm has veered off down that
stream this side of those three headlands over there. The
wind gives and the wind takes away. You can&#8217;t plow a
guard around it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They sat down by the cabin door to watch the storm and
flame blown far away in whirls of glaring light and surging
cloud, until the rain at last drowned all the fury and washed
it over the edge of the south horizon out of the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometime we&#8217;ll plant hedges and forest trees and
checker the country with windbreaks until days like this will
belong only to an old pioneer&#8217;s memory,&#8221; Asher said, as
the storm swept wide away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;m glad I came early enough to see this. I&#8217;m
getting &#8217;plains-broke&#8217; along with Juno. Isn&#8217;t it wonderful
to be a real pioneer? Back in Virginia we were two centuries
of generations away from the first settlers,&#8221; Virginia
exclaimed.</p>
<p>But Asher did not answer. He was thinking of Jim Shirley&#8217;s
declaration: &#8220;She&#8217;s got endurance as well as grace
and beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Virginia Aydelot soon grew brown as a berry in
the tanning prairie winds, and it seemed impossible
that this strong young woman of the sod cabin, with her
simple dress and her cheeks abloom, could have been the
dainty child of the old Southern mansion house.</p>
<p>No other autumn had ever seemed quite so beautiful to
the Aydelots as this, their first autumn together. Life was
before them with its call to victory. Youth and health,
exuberant spirits and love were theirs. Theirs, too, was the
great boundless world of mists and mirages, of rainbow
tinted grasses and opal heavens, where no two sunsets were
ever the same. They could laugh at their poverty, believing
in a time when Ease and Plenty would rule the land
where now they must fight for the bare necessities of existence,
picturing life not as it was then with its many hardships,
but as it would be in a future day when the real
world whose last outpost they had left almost fifty miles
to the eastward, should move toward them and help to
people the prairies.</p>
<p>All the week days were full of duties, but every Sabbath
morning found the three settlers of the valley making a
prairie sanctuary of the Aydelot cabin. The elder Aydelots
had not united with any church, but Asher and Jim, when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
they were only boys, had been converted at a Methodist
revival in Cloverdale. It was an old-fashioned kind of
religious leading, but it was strong enough to hold the two
for all the years that followed. Virginia had been reared
an Episcopalian, but the men out-voted her and declared
that the Aydelot home was the Sunflower Inn for six days in
the week, but on the seventh it was the &#8220;First Methodist
Church of the Conference of the Prairies.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no levity in its service, however, and He who
dwelleth not in temples made with men&#8217;s hands blessed with
his own benediction of peace and trust and courage the
three who set up their altar to Him in this far-away place.</p>
<p>On Sabbath afternoons they explored the sand dunes and
grassy levels up and down the river. Sometimes they rode
northward to the main trail in hope of sighting some prairie
schooner coming hitherward, but not once that season did
the trail hold a human being for them.</p>
<p>October slipped into November with a gradual sharpening
of the frosty air. Everything had been made as snug
as possible for the winter. The corrals were enlarged for
the stock. The houses and stables were thatched against
the cold and storms; and fuel and food were carefully
stored. But November was almost passed before the end
of the bright and sometimes even balmy days.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must have Jim up to the Sunflower Inn for Thanksgiving
dinner. Might as well invite the whole neighborhood,&#8221;
Asher said one evening, as he helped Virginia with
the supper dishes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m planning a real dinner, too,&#8221; his wife declared,
&#8220;just like old Mammy Diane used to cook. You couldn&#8217;t
tell it from hers if you&#8217;d ever eaten one of her spreads.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it will taste about as near like one of Diane&#8217;s
meals as you will look like the cook that made her meals,&#8221;
Asher answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m getting along that way. Look at my tanned
arms now. There&#8217;s a regular dead line, a perfect fireguard
at the elbow. And my muscles, Mammy Diane would say,
&#8217;is jus&#8217; monst&#8217;ous.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia pushed back her sleeve to show the well-marked
line where white above met tan below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim will think anything is better than eating alone out
of his own grub box, and your dinner will be a feast,&#8221;
Asher said, opening the door to carry out the dish water.
&#8220;What do you think of this?&#8221;</p>
<p>A gust of cold rain swished in as the door fell open.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our rain is here, at last. Maybe it will bring snow for
Thanksgiving, and we could have a touch of New England
here,&#8221; Virginia said.</p>
<p>The pelting rain and deepening chill made the little home
a very snug nest that night. There was only one stove
to warm the house, but they kept up a fiction of parlor and
dining room, kitchen and bed chamber. Even the library
was there, although it encroached dreadfully on the parlor,
bedroom and kitchen, all three, for it consisted of space
enough for two chairs, one footstool, and a tiny lamp-stand,
beside which they spent their evenings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s likely to drop in tonight, and what&#8217;s the program
for the evening: charades, music, readings, dancing,
cribbage, or political speeches?&#8221; Asher inquired.</p>
<p>They had invented all sorts of pastimes, with make-believe
audiences, such as little children create for their
plays. For these two were children in a big child world.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
The wilderness is never grown up. It is Nature&#8217;s little one
waiting to be led on and disciplined to mature uses. Asher
and Virginia had already peopled the valley with imaginary
settlers, each one of a certain type, and they adapted their
pastime to the particular neighbors whom they chose to
invite for the evening. How little the helpless folk in the
city, bored with their own dullness, and dependent on others
for amusement&mdash;how little could such as these cope with
the loneliness of the home on the plains, or comprehend the
resourcefulness of the home-makers there!</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s just spend the evening alone. It&#8217;s too stormy
for the Arnolds and Archibalds beyond the Deep Bend, and
the Spoopendykes have relatives from the East and the Gilliwigs
are all down with colds.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia had tucked herself down in the one rocking
chair, with her feet on the footstool.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s such a nice night to be to ourselves. Watch the
rain washing that west window. It&#8217;s getting worse. I
always think of Jim on nights like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So do I,&#8221; Asher said, as he sat down in the armed chair
he had made for himself of cottonwood limbs with a gunny
sack seat. &#8220;He&#8217;s all alone with his dog these dark nights,
and loneliness cuts to the heart of a man like Jim. I&#8217;m glad
I have you, Virginia. I couldn&#8217;t do without you now. The
rain is getting heavier every minute. Sounds like it was
thumping on the door. Listen to that wind!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me about Jim, Asher. What made him come out
here anyhow?&#8221; Virginia asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know all the story. Jim has never seemed to
want to tell me, and I&#8217;ve never cared to ask him,&#8221; Asher
replied. &#8220;When we were away together at school, he was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
in love with one of the prettiest girls that Ohio ever grew.
She lived in the country up the valley from Cloverdale.
Her name was Alice Leigh, and she was a whole cut above
the neighborhood. Jim said she was an artist, could do
wonderful things with a brush and she was just wild to go
somewhere and take lessons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim was planning always how to give her the opportunity
to do it, but her mother, who owned a lot of land
for that country and could afford to send Alice away to
study, couldn&#8217;t see any dollar sign in it, so she kept her
daughter on the farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asher paused and looked at Virginia. His own happiness
made his voice tremble as he went on.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has a brother Tank. I suppose his real name is
Thaddeus, or Tantalus, or something like it; I never knew,
and I never liked him well enough to ask. Tank was a
black-eyed little runt whom none of the boys liked, a
grasping cuss, younger than Jim, and as selfish as Jim is
kind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just before I came West to scout the Indians off the
map, Jim came back to school one time so unlike himself
that I made him tell me what was the matter. It was Tank,
he said, who was making trouble for him up in the Leigh
neighborhood, and he was so grieved and unhappy, I
wouldn&#8217;t ask any more about it. I left for the West soon
after that. When I went back to Cloverdale, Tank Shirley
had married Alice Leigh and her mother&#8217;s farm, and
Jim had left the country. I ran on to him by accident up
at Carey&#8217;s Crossing when I came West again, but I&#8217;ve never
heard him say a word about the matter, and, of course, I
don&#8217;t mention it, although I believe it would do Jim good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
if he could bring himself to tell me about it. He&#8217;s never
been quite the same since. He has a little tendency to lung
trouble, which the plains air is taking out of him, but he&#8217;s
had a bad attack of pneumonia, and it&#8217;s an old enemy of
his, as it always is to a man of his physique. He&#8217;s a
good worker, but lacks judgment to make his work count.
Doesn&#8217;t really seem to have much to work for. But he&#8217;s
a friend to the last ditch. Just hear the rain!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to be knocking against the door again,&#8221; Virginia
said, &#8220;and how the wind does howl! Poor Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to that! Sounds like something loose against
the window. There&#8217;s something out there.&#8221; Asher started
up with the words.</p>
<p>Something white had seemed to splash up against the
window and drop back again. It splashed up a second
time, and fell again. Asher hurried to the door, and as
he opened it, Pilot, the big white-throated dog from the
Shirley claim, came bounding in, so wet and shaggy he
seemed to bring all the storm in with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Pilot, what&#8217;s the news?&#8221; Asher asked. &#8220;Jim&#8217;s
sent him, Virgie. He&#8217;s done this trick often.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pilot slipped to the warm stove and shook a whole shower
out of his long, wet hair, while Asher carefully untied a
little leather bag fastened to the collar under the dog&#8217;s
throat.</p>
<p>&#8220;You brave fellow. You&#8217;ve come all the way in the rain
to bring me this.&#8221;</p>
<p>He held up a little metal box from which he took a bit
of paper. Bending close to the lamp, he read the message
it contained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something is wrong, Virginia. He says, &#8217;I need you.&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
What&#8217;s the matter with Jim, Pilot? Come here and get up
in the chair!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog whimpered and sat still.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come out here, then! Come on, I tell you!&#8221; Asher
started as if to open the door, but the dog did not move.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not out of doors, and he isn&#8217;t sitting up in a
chair. Tell me, now, Pilot, exactly where Jim is! Jim, mind
you!&#8221;</p>
<p>The dog looked at him with watchful eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Jim? Poor Jim!&#8221; Asher repeated, and Pilot,
with a sorrowful yelp, stretched himself at full length beside
the stove.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim&#8217;s sick, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>Pilot wagged his tail understandingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virgie, Jim needs me. I must go to him.&#8221; Asher
looked at his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Jim needs you, you&#8217;ll need me,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;And we&#8217;ll both need Pilot. So we&#8217;ll keep all the human
beings together,&#8221; Asher said, as he helped his wife to fasten
her heavy cloak and tie a long old-fashioned nubia about
her head.</p>
<p>Then they went out into the darkness and the chilling
rain, as neighbor to neighbor, answering this cry for help.</p>
<p>Pilot ran far ahead of them and was waiting with a dog&#8217;s
welcome when they reached Shirley&#8217;s cabin. But the
master, lying where he caught the chill draught from the
open door, was rigid with cold. A sudden attack of pneumonia
had left him helpless. And tonight, Pilot, doing a
dog&#8217;s best, did not understand the danger of leaving doors
open, and of joyously shaking his wet fur down on the
sick man to whom help was coming none too soon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Jim! We&#8217;re all here, doctor, nurse, cook, and
hired man, and the little dog under the wagon,&#8221; Asher said
cheerily, bending over Jim&#8217;s bunk. &#8220;That pup pretty
nearly killed you with kindness, didn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim smiled wanly, then looked blankly away and lay
very still.</p>
<p>The plains frontier had no use for the one talent folk.
People must know how to take care of life there. Asher&#8217;s
first memory of Virginia was when she bent over him, fighting
the fever in a prison hospital. He knew her talent for
helping, and he had fairly estimated her quick ingenuity
for this sod house emergency. But a new vision of the
plains life came to her as she watched him, gentle-handed,
swift, but unhurried, never giving an inch to the enemy in
fighting with death for the life of Jim Shirley.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s safe from that congestion,&#8221; Asher said when the
morning broke. &#8220;But his fever will come on now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you learn to do all these things for sick
people?&#8221; Virginia asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Partly from a hospital nurse I had in the war. Also,
it&#8217;s a part of the game here. I learned a few things fighting
the cholera in sixty-seven. We must look everything on
the frontier squarely in the face, danger and death along with
the rest, just as we have to do everywhere else, only we have
to depend on each other more here. Hold on there, Jim!&#8221;</p>
<p>Asher sprang toward Shirley, who was sitting upright,
staring wildly at the two. Then a struggle began, for the
sick man, crazed with delirium, was bent on driving his
helpers from the cabin. When he lay back exhausted at
length, Asher turned to his wife.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of us must go to Carey&#8217;s Crossing for a doctor.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
You can&#8217;t hold Jim. It&#8217;s all I can do to hold him. But
it&#8217;s a long way to Carey&#8217;s. Can you go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try,&#8221; Virginia replied. And Asher remembered
what Jim had said on the windy September day: &#8220;She&#8217;s
as good a woman as we are men.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must take Pilot with you and leave him at home.
You can&#8217;t get lost, for you know the way up to the main
trail, and that runs straight to the Crossing. Dr. Carey
knows Jim, and he will come if he can, I am sure. He
pulled Jim back once a year or two ago when the pneumonia
had him. Heaven keep you safe, you brave little
soul. Jim may turn the trick for us some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>He kissed her good-by and watched her gallop away on
her errand of mercy.</p>
<p>&#8220;The men will have all the credit by and by for settling
this country. Little glory will come to their wives,&#8221; he
thought. &#8220;And yet, the women make anchor for every
hearthstone, and share in every deed of daring and every
test of endurance. God make me worthy of such a wife!&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia Aydelot had spoken truly when she declared
that the war had left the Thaines little except inherited
pride and the will to do as they pleased. Inherited tendencies
take varying turns. What had made a reformer of old
Jean Aydelot made a narrow bigot of his descendant,
Francis. What had made a proud, exclusive autocrat of
Jerome Thaine, in Virginia Thaine developed into a pride
of conquest for the good of others. It was this pride and
the Thaine will to do as she pleased in defiance of the prairie
perils that sent her now on this errand of mercy for a
neighbor in need. And she took little measure of the
reality of the journey. But she was prudent enough to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
stop at the Sunflower Inn and make ready for it. She
slipped on a warm jacket under her heavy cloak, and put on
her thickest gloves and overshoes. She wound a long red
scarf about her neck and swathed her head in the gray
nubia. Then she mounted her horse for her long, hard ride.</p>
<p>The little sod house with all its plainness seemed very
cosy as she took leave of it, and the woman instinct for
home made its outcry in her when she turned her face
resolutely from its sheltering warmth and felt the force
of the north wind whipping mercilessly upon her. But she
steeled herself to meet the cold, and her spirits rose with the
effort.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a mean little wind. Not half as big as the September
zephyrs. Do your worst, you can&#8217;t scare me,&#8221; she
cried, tucking her head down against its biting breath.</p>
<p>Upon the main trail the snow that had fallen after midnight
deepened in the lower places as the wind whirled it
from the prairie swells. It was not smooth traveling,
although the direction of the trail was clear enough at first.</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s heart bounded hopefully as Juno covered mile
after mile with that persistent, steady canter that means
everything good for a long ride. But the open plains were
bitterly cold and the wind grew fiercer as the hours passed.
High spirits and hope began to give place to determination
and endurance. Virginia shut her teeth in a dogged resolve
not to give up. Indeed, she dared not give up. She must
go on. A life depended on her now, and two lives might
be forfeited if she let this unending wind chill her to
forgetfulness.</p>
<p>And so, alone in a white cruelty of solitary land,
bounded only by the gray cruelty of the sky, with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
dimming trail before her under a deeper snowfall, and with
long miles behind her, she struggled on.</p>
<p>She tried to think of everything cheerful and good. She
tried to find comfort in the help she would take to Jim.
Truly, she was not nearly so cold now and she was very
weary and a wee bit sleepy. A tendency to droop in the
saddle was overcoming her. She roused herself quickly,
and with a jerk at the reins plunged forward at a gallop.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take the stupor out of me,&#8221; she cried.</p>
<p>Then the reins drooped and the fight with the numbing
cold began again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder how far along I am. I must be nearly there.
I remember we lost sight of Carey&#8217;s Crossing soon after
we left last September. Some swell of ground cut us off
quickly&mdash;and I&#8217;ve never seen a human being since then,
except Asher and Jim Shirley and Pilot,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;The snow is so much heavier right here. It varies so.
I&#8217;ve passed half a dozen changes, but this is the deepest
yet. I&#8217;m sure I can see the town beyond this slope ahead.
Why! where&#8217;s the trail, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was nearing mid-afternoon. Neither horse nor rider
had had food nor water, save once when Juno drank at a
crossing. Virginia sat still, conscious suddenly that she
has missed the trail somewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t far, I know. Could I have left it when I took
that gallop?&#8221; she asked herself.</p>
<p>She was wide awake now, for the reality of the situation
was upon her, and she searched madly for some sign of the
trail. In that level prairie sea there was no sign to show
where the trail might lie. The gray sky was pitiless still,
and with no guiding ray of sunshine the points of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
compass failed, and the brave woman lost all sense of
direction.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t give up,&#8221; she said at last, despairingly, &#8220;but
we may as well rest a little before we try again.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had dropped down a decided slope and hurried to a
group of low bushes in a narrow draw. While the wind
was sliding the snow endlessly back and forth on the higher
ground, the bushes were moveless. Slipping to the ground
beside them, she stamped her feet and swung her arms until
the blood began to warm her chilled body.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is so much warmer here. But what next? Oh, dear
Father, help me, help me!&#8221; she cried in the depth of her
need.</p>
<p>And again the same clear whisper that had spoken to her
on the headland when she watched the September prairie
fire, a voice from out of the vast immensity of the Universe,
came to her soul with its calm strength.</p>
<p>&#8220;The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the
everlasting arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>How many a time in the days of winning the wilderness
did the blessed promise come to the pioneer women who
braved the frontier to build the homes of a conquering
nation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t try that blind game again for awhile,&#8221; Virginia
said to herself. &#8220;I&#8217;ll run up a distress signal; maybe
somewhere help is coming to me. I know now how Jim felt
all alone with only a dog&#8217;s instinct to depend on. I&#8217;m
glad I&#8217;ve tried to help him, even if I have failed.&#8221;</p>
<p>She unwound the long red scarf from her neck and bound
her nubia closer about her throat. Then bending the
tallest bush that she could reach she fastened the bright
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
fabric to its upper limbs and let it swing to its place again.
The scarf spread a little in the breeze and hung above her,
a dumb signal of distress where help was not.</p>
<p>The minutes dragged by like hours to Virginia, trying
vainly to decide on what to do next. The fury of a Plains
blizzard would have quickly overcome her, but this was a
lingering fight against cold and a pathless solitude. Suddenly
the memory of one lonely Sabbath day came to her,
and how Asher, always resourceful, had said:</p>
<p>&#8220;When you are afraid, pray; but when you are lonely,
sing.&#8221;</p>
<p>She had prayed, and comfort had come with the prayer.
She could sing for comfort, if for nothing else. Somebody
might hear. And so she sang. The song heard sometimes
in the little prayer meeting in some country church; sometimes
by sick beds when the end of days is drawing near;
sometimes in hours of shipwreck, above the roar of billows
on wide, stormy seas; and sometimes on battlefields when
mangled forms lie waiting the burial trench and the mournful
drumbeat of the last Dead March&mdash;the same song rose
now on the lonely prairie winds sweeping out across the
hidden trails and bleak open plains.</p>

<p>The little postoffice at Carey&#8217;s Crossing in Wolf
County was full of men waiting for the mail due at
noon. Mail came thrice a week now, and business on the
frontier was looking brighter. The postoffice was only one
feature of the room it occupied. Drugs, hardware, horse-feed,
groceries, and notions each had claims of their own,
while beside the United States Mail Department was an inksplashed
desk holding a hotel register, likewise inksplashed.
Beyond the storeroom was a long, narrow dining room on
one side and a few little cell-like rooms on the other with a
crack of a hall between them leading back to the kitchen,
the whole structure, only one story high, having more
vertical boards than horizontal in its making. But the lettering
over the front door bore the brave information that
this was the Post Office, the General Merchandise Store, and
the Jacobs House, all in one.</p>
<p>The rain of the night had shifted to a light snow that
whiffed about in little white pellets, adding nothing to the
land in the way of moisture, or beauty, or protection from
cold. Just a chill fraying out of the rain&#8217;s end that
matched the bitterness of the wind&#8217;s long sweep from out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
of the vast northwest. A gray sky was clamped down over
all, so dull and monotonous, it seemed that no rainbow tint
could ever again brighten the world.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stage is late again,&#8221; observed one of the men.</p>
<p>&#8220;Always is when you want her particular.&#8221; This from
a large man who held the door open long enough to stare
up the open street for the sign of the coming stage and
to let in a surge of cold air at the same time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, shut the door, Champers. The stage doesn&#8217;t
come inside. It stops at Hans Wyker&#8217;s saloon first, anyhow,&#8221;
one of the men behind a counter declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d open a bar here you&#8217;d do some business and
run that Wyker fellow out. Steward, you and Jacobs are
too danged satisfied with yourselves. We need some business
spirit in this town if we want to get the county seat
here,&#8221; Champers declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;That may help your real estate, but it&#8217;s not my kind
of business, and no bar is going into this tavern,&#8221; Jacobs
replied, leaning his elbow against the back of Stewart, who
was bending over the desk.</p>
<p>Stewart and Jacobs were young men, the former a finely
built, fair-haired Scotchman from whom good nature, good
health, and good morals fairly radiated; not the kind of
man to become a leader, but rather to belong to the substantial
following of a leader.</p>
<p>Jacobs was short, and slender, and dark&mdash;unmistakably
of Jewish blood&mdash;with a keen black eye, quick motions,
and the general air of a shrewd business man, letting no
dollar escape him. He had also the air of a gentleman.
Nobody in Carey&#8217;s Crossing had ever heard him swear&mdash;the
language of the frontier always&mdash;nor seen him drink,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
nor had taken a parcel from his store that had been tied up
with soiled fingers.</p>
<p>The Jacobs House register might be splashed with ink,
but the ledger records of the business concern were a joy
to the eye.</p>
<p>At Stewart&#8217;s words Champers shut the door with a slam
and blustered toward the stove, crowding smaller men out
of their places before it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad I don&#8217;t have to run other men&#8217;s affairs&mdash;&#8221;he
began, when the rear door flew open and a slender young
Negro hurried in with the announcement:</p>
<p>&#8220;De stage done sighted approachin&#8217; from de east,
gen&#8217;lemen. Hit&#8217;s done comin&#8217; into town right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Bo Peep; take care of the team,&#8221; Stewart
responded, and a general re-swarming of the crowd
followed.</p>
<p>Just before the stage&mdash;a covered wagon drawn by two
Indian ponies&mdash;reached the Jacobs House a young man
crossed the street and entered the door. Some men are born
with a presence that other men must recognize everywhere.
To this man&#8217;s quiet, &#8220;Hello, gentlemen,&#8221; the crowd
responded, almost to a man:</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Carey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Doc.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each man felt the wish to be recognized by such greeting,
and a place was given him at once. Only Champers,
the big man, turned away with a scowl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Always gets the best of everything, even to the first
chance to get his mail,&#8221; he muttered under his breath.</p>
<p>But the mail was soon of secondary interest to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
dealer in real estate. Letters were of less importance to
him than strangers, and a stranger had registered at the
desk and was waiting while Stewart called out the mail in
the postoffice department. Champers leaned over the
shoulders of shorter men to read the entry in a cramped
little hand, the plain name, &#8220;Thomas Smith, Wilmington,
Delaware.&#8221; Then he looked at the man and drew his own
conclusions.</p>
<p>Dr. Carey was standing beside the letter counter when
Todd Stewart read out, &#8220;&#8216;Mr. James Shirley,&#8217;&#8221; and, with
a little scrutiny&mdash;&#8220;&#8216;Southwest of Carey&#8217;s Crossing.&#8217;
Anybody here know Mr. James Shirley?&#8221;</p>
<p>The stranger made a hasty step forward, but Dr. Carey
had already taken the letter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take care of that for you, Stewart,&#8221; he said
quietly. And turning, he looked into the eyes of the
stranger.</p>
<p>It was but a glance, and the latter stepped aside.</p>
<p>Men formed quick judgments on the frontier. As
Carey passed the register he read the latest entry there, and
like Champers he too drew his own conclusions. At the
door he turned and said to Jacobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell Bo Peep to have your best horse ready by one
o&#8217;clock for a long ride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, Doctor,&#8221; Jacobs responded.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the Jacobs House dining room was
crowded for the midday meal. By natural selection men
fell into their places. Stewart and Jacobs, with Dr. Carey
and Pryor Gaines, the young minister school teacher, had
a table to themselves. The other patrons sat at the long
board, while the little side table for two was filled today
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
with Champers, the real estate man, and the latest arrival,
Mr. Thomas Smith, of Wilmington, Delaware.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the man with the dark mustache up there?&#8221;
Thomas Smith asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doc Carey,&#8221; Champers replied with a scowl.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem to need him?&#8221; There was a double
meaning in the query, and Champers caught both.</p>
<p>&#8220;No ways,&#8221; he responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has some influence here?&#8221; the stranger asserted rather
than questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot. Has the whole town under hoodoo. It&#8217;s named
for him. He has all the doctoring he can do and won&#8217;t half
charge, so&#8217;s no other doctor&#8217;ll come here. That&#8217;s no way
to build up a town. He&#8217;d get up at one o&#8217;clock in the
morning to doctor a widder&#8217;s cow. Now, sure he would,
when he knows even a dead cow&#8217;d make business for the
butcher to render up into grease and the cattle dealer to sell
another cow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not your style of a man then?&#8221; the stranger observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw, no, but, as I say, he&#8217;s got the whole country
hoodoo&#8217;d. Notice how everybody give him right of way
to get his mail first? Why him? And hear him order the
best horse? I&#8217;ll bet a tree claim in hades right now that
he&#8217;s off somewhere to doctor some son of a gun out of
cussed good will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is this James Shirley whose mail he seems to look
after?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a half-tone lowering of the voice as Smith
pronounced the name, which was not lost on Champers,
whose business was to catch men at all corners.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim Shirley lives out in one of the rich valleys west.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
Him and a fellow named Aydelot have some big notions of
things out there. I don&#8217;t know the doc&#8217;s claim to control
his mail, but nobody here would deny Carey any danged
thing he wanted.&#8221; Champers twisted his face in disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are in the real estate business here?&#8221; Thomas
Smith asked after a pause, as if the subject fell into
entirely new lines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Champers answered absently with eyes alert on
the opposite wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see you later, Mr.&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Champers&mdash;Darley Champers,&#8221; and the dealer in land
shoved a soiled card across the table. &#8220;Come in any time.
This cold snap will soon be over and I can show you no
end of land worth a gold mine any time you are ready.
But make it soon. Land&#8217;s goin&#8217; faster here&#8217;n you Delaware
fellers think, and&#8221;&mdash;in a lower voice&mdash;&#8220;Doc Carey&#8217;s
drivin&#8217; over it all the time, and that Jew of a Jacobs ain&#8217;t
in business here on account of no lung trouble, and his
hatred of saloons is somethin&#8217; pisen.&#8221;</p>
<p>They finished their meal in silence, for they had come
to an understanding. The afternoon was too short and
cold for real estate business to be brisk, and nobody in
Carey&#8217;s Crossing noted that the front window of Darley
Champer&#8217;s little office was covered with a newspaper blind
all the rest of that day, nor did anybody pay attention to
the whereabouts of the stranger&mdash;Mr. Thomas Smith, of
Wilmington, Delaware&mdash;during this same time. Nobody,
except John Jacobs, of the Jacobs House, who gained his
knowledge mostly by instinct; never, at least, by rude
inquiry. He had been up on the roof helping Bo Peep
to fasten the sign over the door which the wind had torn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
loose. From this place he could see above the newspaper
screen of the window across the street that Champers and
Smith were in a tremendously earnest consultation. He
would have thought nothing of it had not Champers
chanced to sight him on the roof and immediately readjusted
the newspaper blind to prevent observation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll offer to sell Darley a window shade cheap tomorrow
and see how he bites,&#8221; and the little Jewish merchant smiled
shrewdly at the thought.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Out on the trail that day the snow lay deeper to the
westward, hiding the wagon ruts. The dead sunflower
stalks made only a faint black edging along the white
monotony of the way and sometimes on bleak swells there
were no markings at all. Some distance from Carey&#8217;s
Crossing a much heavier snowfall, covering a wide swath,
under which the trails were entirely lost, had wandered in
zigzag lines down from the northwest.</p>
<p>In the early afternoon Dr. Horace Carey had started
west on the surest horse in the Stewart-Jacobs livery stable,
taking his old-fashioned saddle-bags with him through
force of habit, and by mid-afternoon was floundering in
the edge of this deeper snowfall.</p>
<p>Nature must have meant Horace Carey for the plains.
He was of medium height, compactly built, without an
ounce of unnecessary weight. The well-rounded form took
away all hint of spareness, while it did not destroy the
promise of endurance. His heavy, dark hair and dark gray
eyes, his straight nose and firm mouth under a dark mustache,
and his well-set chin made up an attractive but not
handsome face. The magnetism of his personality was not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
in manly beauty. It was an inborn gift and would have
characterized him in any condition in life. There was
about him a genial dignity that made men look up to him
and a willingness to serve that made selfishness seem mean.
He could not have been thirty, although he had been on
the plains for five years. The West was people by young
men. It&#8217;s need for daring spirits found less response in
men of maturer life. But the West had most need for
humane men. The bully, the dare-devil, the brutal, and the
selfish were refuse before the force that swept the frontier
onward; but they were never elements in real state building.
Before such men as Carey they lost power.</p>
<p>The doctor rode away toward the west, bowing his head
before the strong wind that he knew too well to fear, yet
wondering as he rode if he had done wisely to dare the
deepening snow of the buried trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I might have waited a day, anyhow,&#8221; he thought.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a devil of a ride over to Jim Shirley&#8217;s, and we got
only the tag ends of that storm down at the Crossing from
the looks of this. However, I may as well keep at it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>He surged on for a few miles without any signs of an
open trail appearing. Then he dropped to a slow canter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d better get this worry straightened and my mind
untangled if I am to have any comfort on this ride,&#8221; he
said aloud, as was his wont to do when out in the open
alone. &#8220;Everything happens to a man who gives too much
leeway to that indefinite inside guide saying, &#8216;Do this!
Let that alone!&#8217; And yet that guide hasn&#8217;t failed me when
I&#8217;ve listened to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He let the pony have the rein as he looked ahead with
unseeing eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What made me take this day? First, everybody is
well enough to be left for two or three days, good time
for a vacation, and Stewart can take care of emergencies
always. Second, I promised Jim I&#8217;d see that his letters got
to him straightway. Third, yes, third, something said,
&#8216;Go now!&#8217; But here&#8217;s the other side. Why go on the heels
of a snowstorm? Why not keep Jim&#8217;s letter a day or two?
It&#8217;s in my hands. And why mistrust a man who calls himself
innocent &#8216;Thomas Smith?&#8217; That&#8217;s it. He&#8217;s too innocent.
There&#8217;s no place on these wide Kansas prairies for
that man Thomas Smith. He&#8217;d better get back to his home
and his real name at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor smiled at the thought, then he frowned at
the cold wind and the shifting snows above the trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a fool&mdash;a stack of fools, Dr. Horace Carey,
to beat out of town miles on miles on a fool&#8217;s errand over a
lost trail, trusting your instinct that never lost you a
direction yet, and all because of an inward call to an unrevealed
duty. Some other day will do as well. And here&#8217;s
where I may as well cut off these notions of being led by
inside signals. What should make me sight danger in a
man I never saw before, and who will probably go out on
the stage tomorrow morning? Oh, well, the Lord made
us as we are. He knows why.&#8221;</p>
<p>He wheeled the pony about and began to trot toward
Carey&#8217;s Crossing. Suddenly he halted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see. I&#8217;m not twenty miles along, though I&#8217;ve
come at a good rate. I believe I&#8217;ll cut across northwest
and hit some of the settlers up on Big Wolf Creek for
the night. Lucky I&#8217;ve no wife to worry about me.&#8221;</p>
<p>A wave of sadness swept over the man&#8217;s face&mdash;just a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
sweep of sorrow that left no mark. He turned abruptly
from the trail and struck in a definite direction across the
snow-covered prairie. Presently his path veered to the
north, then to northwest.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know an ugly little creek running into Big Wolf
that&#8217;s the dickens to cross. I&#8217;ll run clear round it, even
if it takes longer. After all, I&#8217;m doing just what I said
I wouldn&#8217;t do. I don&#8217;t know why I didn&#8217;t go on, nor why
I am tacking off up here. Something tells me to do it,
and I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>But however changeable of mind he seemed to himself,
Dr. Carey was a man who formed his judgments so quickly
and acted upon them so promptly that he seemed most
stable to other men. He rode forward now to a land wave
that dropped on one side to a creek, a quarter of a mile
away, where black shrubbery marked the water line. A
long swell of wind swung down the valley, whirling the
snow in eddies before it. As the doctor&#8217;s eye followed
them, he suddenly noted a red scarf lift above the tallest
clumps of bushes and flutter out to its full length, then
drop again as the wind swell passed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody in fifteen miles of here. I reckon that
scarf blew there and caught some time this fall when
somebody was going out on the trail. Mighty human
looking thing, though. It seemed waving a signal to me.
But I must hurry on.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hastened at a gallop up the ridge away from the
creek, his mind still on that red scarf flung about by the
winter wind.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a strange thing,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;but every human
token is startling out here. What&#8217;s that now?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></p>
<p>The doctor had a plainsman&#8217;s ear as well as a plainsman&#8217;s
eye. As he listened, through the wail of the wind
borne along the distance, he caught the words of a song,
low and pleading like a plaintive cry for help:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Though, like the wanderer,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>The sun gone down,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Darkness be over me,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>My rest a stone&mdash;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Yet in my dreams I&#8217;d be</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Nearer, my God, to thee,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.735835172921266em;'>Nearer to thee.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>It was a woman&#8217;s voice and Carey faced about to listen.
He knew it came from the bushes below the red scarf. So
he changed his course and hurried around a bend in the
stream to the other side of the brush where Virginia
Aydelot stood beside Juno.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid there isn&#8217;t even a stone to rest on here,
Madam. Can I be of any service to you?&#8221; he said, lifting
his hand toward his cap in semi-military salute.</p>
<p>Virginia stood looking at the stranger with a half-comprehending
gaze. She had been less than an hour
beside the bushes, but it had seemed to her like many hours.
And the terrifying certainty of a night alone on the prairie
made the sudden presence of a human being unreal to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon; I am Dr. Carey, of Carey&#8217;s Crossing,
and I was striking across the prairie to the Big Wolf
settlement when I saw your scarf and heard your singing.
I took them both to be distress signals and came over to
see if you needed me.&#8221;</p>
<p>One had only to listen to Dr. Carey&#8217;s voice to understand
why Darley Champers should accuse him of laying
a charm on the whole settlement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></p>
<p>Virginia recovered herself quickly, saying with a wan
smile:</p>
<p>&#8220;You came just in time, Doctor. I am lost and need
help. I was going to you, anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>Each one&#8217;s face was so muffled against the wind that
the eyes and lips and a bit of the cheeks alone were visible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bad-looking woman for all the Kansas tan,&#8221; the
doctor thought. &#8220;She has a voice like a true Virginian
and fine eyes and teeth. But any woman who bundles up
for a horseback ride across the plains on a day like this
isn&#8217;t out for a beauty show contest. I&#8217;ve seen eyes like
that before, though, and as to her voice&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Mrs. Asher Aydelot from the Grass River Valley,&#8221;
Virginia went on. &#8220;There are only three settlers out
there now, Mr. Shirley and my husband and myself. Mr.
Shirley is very sick with pneumonia, and Mr. Aydelot could
not leave him, so I started to Carey&#8217;s Crossing to see if you
could come to him. I missed the trail somewhere. I was
trying to help, but I failed, you see.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor was looking at her with a puzzled expression
which she thought was born of his sympathy. To the
mention of her failing he responded quickly:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Mrs. Aydelot, you succeeded. I had started to
Shirley&#8217;s myself on personal business, and I was letting
some whim turn me aside. If you had kept the trail we
should have missed each other, for I was on my way to
Big Wolf Creek, a good distance away, and your leaving
the trail and wandering down here was providential for
Shirley. Shall I show you on to the Crossing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, Doctor, if you will only come back with me.
I don&#8217;t want to go on,&#8221; Virginia insisted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are a regular westerner, Mrs. Aydelot,&#8221; Carey
declared. &#8220;But you haven&#8217;t been out here long. I heard
of your passing through our town late last summer. I
was up on Big Wolf then and failed to see you. I
know something of your husband, but I have never met
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>He helped her to mount her horse and together they
sought the trail and followed it westward in the face of
the wind.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Near midnight down in Jim Shirley&#8217;s cabin Asher
Aydelot turned from a lull in the sick man&#8217;s ravings to
see Dr. Horace Carey entering the door with a pair of
saddle bags in his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, sir! Aydelot? I&#8217;m Carey, the doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then as his quick eye took in the haggard face of the
man before him, he said cheerily:</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything fit as a fiddle up your way. I left your
cabin snug and warm as a prairie dog&#8217;s hole, and your
wife is sound asleep by this time, with a big dog on guard.
Yes, I understand,&#8221; he added, as Asher silently gripped
his hand. &#8220;You&#8217;ve died a thousand deaths today. Forget
it, and give me a hand here. My own are too stiff, and I
must get these wet boots off. I always go at my work
dry shod.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had pulled a pair of heavy shoes from the saddle
bags, and was removing his outer coat and sundry scarfs,
warming his hands between whiles and seemingly unconscious
of the sick man&#8217;s presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are wet to the knees. You dared the short trail
and the strange fords of rivers on a night so dark as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
this,&#8221; Asher declared as he helped Carey to put off his
wrappings.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a doctor&#8217;s business to forget himself when he sees
a distress signal.&#8221; Then Carey added quietly: &#8220;Tell
me about Shirley. What have you been doing for
him?&#8221;</p>
<p>He was beside Jim&#8217;s bunk now and his presence seemed
to fill the whole cabin with its subtle strength.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know your business, doctor; I&#8217;m a farmer,&#8221;
Asher said, as he watched this frontier physician moving
deftly about his work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you mean to farm so far from pill bags you
have done well to follow my trade a little, as you seem to
have done with Shirley,&#8221; Carey asserted, as he noted the
evidences of careful nursing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Virginia&mdash;Mrs. Aydelot&mdash;helped me,&#8221; Asher
assured him. &#8220;She&#8217;s a nurse by instinct.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you call your wife?&#8221; the doctor inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virginia&mdash;from her own state. Pretty sick man
here.&#8221; Asher said this as Dr. Carey suddenly bent over
Shirley with stern eyes and tightening lips. But the eyes
grew tender when Jim looked up into his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re all right, Shirley. You must go to sleep now.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Shirley, who in his delirium had fought his neighbor
all day, became as obedient as a child, as a very sick child,
that night under Horace Carey&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>The next morning Virginia Aydelot was not able to
rise from her bed, and for many days she could do nothing
more than to sit in the rocking chair by the windows and
absorb sunshine.</p>
<p>On the fourth day after Carey had reached Shirley&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
Asher went down the river in the early afternoon to find
how Jim&#8217;s case was progressing, leaving his wife comfortably
tucked up in the rocking chair by the west window.
The snow was gone and the early December day was
as crisp and beautiful as an Indian summer day in a colder
climate. Virginia sat watching the shadows of the clouds
flow along the ground and the prairie hues changing with
the angle of the afternoon sunlight. Suddenly a sound
of ponies&#8217; feet outside was followed by a loud rap on the
door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in!&#8221; Virginia called. &#8220;Lie down, Pilot!&#8221;</p>
<p>Pilot did not obey, but sat up alert before his mistress
as Darley Champers&#8217; bulk filled the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, Madam,&#8221; the real estate dealer said, lifting
his hat, &#8220;Me and my friend, Mr. Smith out there, are
looking up a claim for a friend of ours somewhere out in
the Grass River settlement. Can you tell me who owns the
last claim taken up down the river, and how far it is from
here?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Shirley&#8217;s claim is a few miles down the river, if
you go by the short trail and ford at the bends, but much
longer if you go around by the long trail,&#8221; Virginia
explained.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it occupied?&#8221; Champers put the question in a
careless tone.</p>
<p>Pilot&#8217;s bristles, that had fallen at the sound of Virginia&#8217;s
voice, rose again with the query. It is well to be wary of
one whom a dog distrusts. But the woman&#8217;s instinct in
Virginia responded little to the dog&#8217;s uneasiness, and she
replied courteously:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Shirley is there, very sick.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Um, who have I the honor of addressing now?&#8221;
Champers asked awkwardly, as if to change the subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Asher Aydelot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now, I&#8217;ve heard of Aydelot. Where is your
man today? I&#8217;d like to meet him, Mrs. A.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the man&#8217;s way of being friendly, but even a
duller-fibred man than Champers would have understood
Mrs. Aydelot&#8217;s tone as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You will find him at Shirley&#8217;s, or on the way. Only
the long trail winds around some bluffs, and you might pass
each other without knowing it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How many men in this settlement now?&#8221; Champers
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only two,&#8221; Virginia replied, patting Pilot&#8217;s head
involuntarily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only two! That&#8217;s sixteen more&#8217;n&#8217;ll ever make it go
here,&#8221; Darley Champers declared. &#8220;Excuse me for saying
it, Mrs. Aydelot, but I&#8217;ve been pretty much over
Kansas, and this is the poorest show for settlement the
Lord ever left out of doors. I&#8217;ve always heard this valley
was full of claims you simply couldn&#8217;t give away, but my
friend, who has no end of money and influence fur developin&#8217;
the country, wanted me to look over the ground
along the Grass River, It&#8217;s dead desolation, that&#8217;s all; no
show on earth in fifty year out here, and in fifty year we
won&#8217;t none of us care for more&#8217;n six feet of ground anywhere.
I&#8217;m sorry for you, Madam. You must be awfully
lonely here, but you&#8217;ll be gettin&#8217; away soon, I hope. I
must be off. Thank you, Madam, for the information.
Good day,&#8221; and he left the cabin abruptly.</p>
<p>The sunshine grew pallid and the prairies lay dull and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
endless. The loneliness of solitude hung with a dead heaviness
and hope beat at the lowest ebb for Virginia Aydelot,
trying bravely to deny his charge against the future of
the land she had struggled so to dream into fruitfulness.
She was only a woman, strong to love and brave to endure,
but neither by nature nor heritage shrewd to read the
tricks of selfish trade. And she believed that while Asher
and Jim Shirley were hopeful dreamers like herself, here
was an ill-mannered but unprejudiced man who saw the
situation as they could not see it.</p>
<p>&#8220;That woman and her fool dog were half afraid of me
at first. They don&#8217;t know that women aren&#8217;t in my line.
I&#8217;d never harm a one of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re in my line always. Was she good looking?
I never pass a pretty woman,&#8221; Thomas Smith said smoothly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a danged fool, Smith. I might cut a man&#8217;s
throat to some extent, if it would help my business any,
but I&#8217;d cut it more&#8217;n some if he forgets his manners round
a woman. We&#8217;re a coarse, grasping lot out here fur as
property goes, and we ain&#8217;t got drawing-room manners,
but it takes your smug little easterners to be the real dirty
devils. Come on.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Thomas Smith knew that the big, coarse-grained
man was sincere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yonder&#8217;s Aydelot now. Want to see him?&#8221; Darley
Champers declared, sighting Asher down the short trail
beyond the deep bend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve no business with him, and he&#8217;s the man I don&#8217;t
want to see,&#8221; Thomas Smith said hastily. &#8220;I&#8217;ll ride on
out of sight round this bend and wait for you. It&#8217;s a
good place when you don&#8217;t want to be seen.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Depends on how much of a plainsman Aydelot is. He
ought to have sighted both of us half a mile back,&#8221;
Champers declared.</p>
<p>But Smith hurried away and was soon behind the low
bluff at the deep bend. Asher Aydelot had seen the two
before they saw him, and he saw them part company and
only one come on to meet him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re Aydelot from the claim up the river, I s&#8217;pose.
I&#8217;m just out lookin&#8217; at the country. Not much to it but
looks,&#8221; Champers declared as the two met at the deep bend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; my name is Aydelot,&#8221; Asher replied, deciding
at once that this stranger was not to be accepted on sight, a
judgment based not on a woman&#8217;s instinct but on a man&#8217;s
experience.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any of these claims ever been entered?&#8221; Champers
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir; most of them,&#8221; Asher responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Couldn&#8217;t make it out here. I s&#8217;pose you&#8217;ll get
out next. Hard place to take root. Most too far away,
and land&#8217;s a little thin, I see,&#8221; the real estate dealer remarked
carelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s pretty well out,&#8221; Asher assented.</p>
<p>&#8220;The river ever get low here?&#8221; was the next query.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not often, in the winter,&#8221; Asher replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most too uncertain for water power, though, and the
railroad ain&#8217;t comin&#8217; this way at all. I must be gettin&#8217; on.
One man&#8217;s too few to be travelin&#8217; so fur from civilization.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come up to the cabin for the night,&#8221; Asher said, with
a plainsman&#8217;s courtesy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, no. Hope to see you again nearer to the
Lord&#8217;s ground; losin&#8217; game here. Good-by.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></p>
<p>Asher did not look like a disappointed man when he
reached the Sunflower Inn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Best news in the world,&#8221; he declared when Virginia
related what had happened in the cabin that afternoon.
&#8220;A man who goes prospecting around the Kansas prairies
doesn&#8217;t discourage the poor cuss he pities; he tries to
encourage the wretch to hold on to land he wouldn&#8217;t have
himself. Listen to me, Virgie. That man has his eye on
Grass River right now. I know his breed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the early dusk found Champers and Smith
approaching Shirley&#8217;s premises.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about Aydelot,&#8221; Champers declared as
they lariated their ponies beyond the corral. &#8220;He&#8217;s one of
the clear-eyed fellows who sees a good thing about as soon
as you sight it yourself, and then he turns clam and leach
and you won&#8217;t move him nor get nothin&#8217; out of him, and
that&#8217;s all there is to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know that. I mean, you say he does?&#8221; Smith
seemed too preoccupied to follow his own words, but
Champers followed Smith shrewdly enough.</p>
<p>They made a hasty but careful examination of the
premises, keeping wide of the cabin where the sick man lay.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got three horses in there. He&#8217;s well fixed,&#8221;
Champers declared, peering into the stable, where it was
too dark to discover that the third horse was Dr. Carey&#8217;s.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s hike off for some deserted shack for the night and
get an early start for the Crossing in the morning. Easy
trick, this, gettin&#8217; in and out of here unseen. And it&#8217;s one
of the best claims on Grass River.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t we slip into the cabin?&#8221; Smith asked in a
half whisper. &#8220;If he&#8217;s too sick&#8221;&mdash;Something in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
man&#8217;s face made it look diabolical in the fading twilight,
and he seemed about to start toward the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, see here, Mr. Smith,&#8221; Champers said with slow
sternness. &#8220;What&#8217;d I say back there about women?
Neither we ain&#8217;t man-slaughterers out here, though your
<i>Police Gazette</i> and your dime novels paint us that way.
There&#8217;s more murderers per capiter to a single street in
New York than in the whole state of Kansas, right now.
If it&#8217;s land and money, we&#8217;re after it, tooth an&#8217; toenail, but
forget the thing in your mind this minute or you an&#8217; me
parts company right here, an&#8217; you can hoof it back to
Carey&#8217;s Crossing or Wilmington, Delaware.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith made no reply and they mounted their ponies and
galloped away.</p>
<p>And all the while Dr. Horace Carey, inside the unlighted
cabin, had watched their movements with grim curiosity,
even to the hesitating, half-expressed intention of entering
the dwelling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Champers would pull up another man&#8217;s stakes and drive
them into his own ground if he wanted them, but that
Thomas Smith would drive them through the other fellow&#8217;s
body if nobody else was around,&#8221; was the doctor&#8217;s mental
comment as he went outside and watched the course of the
two men till the twilight gathered them in.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When the turning point came to the sick man, the
up-climb was marvelous, as his powers of recoil asserted
themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just a matter of self-control and good spirits
now, Shirley, and you have both,&#8221; Dr. Carey said, as he
sat by his patient on the ninth day.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You staid the game out, Carey,&#8221; Shirley said with an
undertone of hopelessness behind his smile. &#8220;What possessed
you to happen in, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was possessed not to come and turned back after I&#8217;d
started. If I hadn&#8217;t met Mrs. Aydelot coming after me
I&#8217;d have rampsed off up on Big Wolf Creek for a week,
maybe, and missed your case entirely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And likewise my big fee,&#8221; Jim interrupted. &#8220;Some
men are born lucky. And so Mrs. Aydelot went after you.
Asher&#8217;s a fortunate man to have a wife like Virginia,
although he had to give up an inheritance for her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How was that?&#8221; Carey asked, glad to see the hopeless
look leaving Jim&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s a pretty long story for a sick man. The
mere facts are that Asher Aydelot was to have bank stock,
a good paying hotel, and a splendid big farm if he&#8217;d
promise never to marry any descendant of Jerome Thaine,
of Virginia. Asher hiked out West and enlisted in the
cavalry and did United States scout duty for two years,
hoping to forget Virginia Thaine, who is a descendant of
this Jerome Thaine. But it wasn&#8217;t any use. Distance
don&#8217;t count, you know, in cases like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shirley was too sick to notice Dr. Carey&#8217;s face, and he
did not remember afterward how low and hard those three
words sounded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems Virginia had pulled Asher through a fever
in a Rebel hospital, and we all love our nurses.&#8221; Jim patted
the doctor&#8217;s knee as he said this. &#8220;And when the father&#8217;s
will was read out against ever, ever, ever his son marrying
a Thaine, Asher promptly said that the whole inheritance,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
bank stock, hotel, and farm, might go where&mdash;the old
man Aydelot had already gone&mdash;maybe. Anyhow, he
married Virginia Thaine and she was game to come out
here and pioneer on a Grass River claim. Strange what a
woman will do for love, isn&#8217;t it? And to go on a forty-mile
ride to save a worthless pup&#8217;s life! That&#8217;s me. Think
of the daughter of one of those old Virginia homes up to
a trick like that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve talked enough now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shirley looked up in surprise at this stern command,
but Dr. Carey had gone to the other side of the cabin and
sat staring out at the river running bank-full at the base
of the little slope.</p>
<p>When he turned to his patient again, the old tender look
was in his eyes. Men loved Jim Shirley if they cared for
him at all. And now the pathetic hopelessness of Jim&#8217;s
face cut deep as Carey studied it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say, Shirley, did you ever know a man back East
named Thomas Smith?&#8221; he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Strange name, that! Where&#8217;d you run onto it?
Smith! Smith! How do you spell it?&#8221; Jim replied
indifferently.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a spoonful of quinine in epsom salts, taken raw,
if you don&#8217;t pay attention. Now listen to me.&#8221; The doctor&#8217;s
tone was as cheery as ever.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t make it necessary for me to tell you when
you&#8217;ve talked enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of the joking words, there was a listless hopelessness
in Shirley&#8217;s voice, matching the dull, listless eyes.
And Horace Carey rose to the situation at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;A stranger named Thomas Smith came to the Crossing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
the day I came down here. Rather a small man, with close-set,
dark eyes; signed his name in a cramped, left-handed
writing. I noticed his right hand seemed a little stiff, sort
of paralyzed at the wrist. But here&#8217;s the funny thing.
He made me uneasy, and he made me think of you. Could
you identify him? He looked as much like you as I look
like that young darkey, Bo Peep, up at the Jacobs House.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None of my belongings. You are a delicate plant to
be so sensitive to strangers.&#8221; Jim sighed from mental
weariness more than from physical weakness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was sensitive, and when I heard Stewart call out
your name in the mail and saw this man step up as if to
take the letter, I took it. And if you&#8217;ll take a brace and
decide it&#8217;s worth while you can have it. It&#8217;s addressed in
a woman&#8217;s handwriting, not a Thomas Smith style of
pinching letters out of a penholder and squeezing them off
the pen point. Lie down there, man!&#8221;</p>
<p>For Jim was sitting up, listening intently. With trembling
fingers he took the letter and read it eagerly. Then
he looked at Carey with eyes in which listlessness had given
place to determination.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor, I was ready to throw up the game five minutes
ago. Now I&#8217;ll do anything to get back to strength and
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t seem very joyous, however,&#8221; the doctor
responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joy don&#8217;t belong to me. We parted company some
years ago. But life is mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And duty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and duty. Say, Doctor, if you&#8217;d ever cared all
there was in you to care for one woman, and then had to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
give her up, you&#8217;d know how I feel. And if, then, a sort
of service opened up before you, you&#8217;d know how I welcome
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s face, white from his illness, was wonderfully handsome
now, and he looked at his friend with that eager longing
for sympathy men of his mould need deeply. Horace
Carey stood up beside the bed and, looking down with a
face where intense feeling and self-control were manifest,
said in a low voice:</p>
<p>&#8220;I have cared. I have had to give up, and I know
what service means.&#8221;</p>

<p>While Jim Shirley was getting back to health, he
and his physician had many long talks regarding
the West and its future; its products and its people. There
was only one topic in which Horace Carey was but intermittently
interested, namely, Jim&#8217;s neighbors&mdash;the Aydelots.
At least, it seemed so to Jim, who had loved Asher
from boyhood, and had taken Virginia on sight and paid
homage to her for all the years that followed. Jim accepted
the doctor&#8217;s manner at first as a mere personal trait, but,
having nothing to do except to lie and think, he grew
curiously annoyed over it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d tell me what ails you?&#8221; he blurted out
one evening, as the two sat together in the twilight.</p>
<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221; the doctor inquired. &#8220;If I knew, I
might even risk my own medicine to get over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t joke, Horace Carey, not with a frail invalid.
I&#8217;ve tried all day to talk to you about my neighbors and
you turn the subject away as if it was of no consequence,
and now, tonight, you settle down and say, &#8216;Tell me about
the Aydelots.&#8217; Why do you want to hear in the dark what
you won&#8217;t listen to in the daylight?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you are a sick man, Jim, or you wouldn&#8217;t be so
silly,&#8221; the doctor replied, &#8220;but to please you, I&#8217;ll tell
you the truth. I&#8217;m homesick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And this Mrs. Aydelot was a Virginia woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m a true son of Virginia, and I thought it
might make me happy to hear about somebody from&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a magnificent liar,&#8221; Jim broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Evidently it&#8217;s better to have you talk about your
neighbors than your medical advisor tonight,&#8221; Carey
retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I won&#8217;t say a word more,&#8221; Jim declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;More Ananias magnificence! Do you suppose the
Aydelots will be down before we go away?&#8221; the doctor
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;We?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I am going to take you with me, or give you a
quieting powder when I leave here. On your own declaration
you&#8217;d do anything to get back to strength and work.
Now, the only way to get well, with or without a physician,
is to get well. And you&#8217;ll never do that by using up a
little more strength every day than you store up the night
before. Men haven&#8217;t sense enough to be invalids. Nothing
else is such a menace to human life as the will of the man
who owns that life. You&#8217;ll obey my will for a month
or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a&mdash;doctor, Carey. No, the Aydelots won&#8217;t
be down before we go away, because Virginia has been
sick ever since that awful trip to Carey&#8217;s Crossing,&#8221; Jim
said sadly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why haven&#8217;t you told me?&#8221; Carey&#8217;s voice was hardly
audible.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because Asher just told me today, and because you
took no interest in them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sickness is a doctor&#8217;s interest, always,&#8221; Carey replied
in a stern voice. And then the two sat in silence while the
night shadows darkened the little cabin.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>As soon as Shirley was able to ride, he went up to Carey&#8217;s
Crossing for a two months&#8217; stay, and the Aydelots were
left far away from the edge of civilization. A heavy
snowfall buried all the trails and the world, the happy, busy
world, forgot these two holding their claim on the grim
wilderness frontier.</p>
<p>In after years they often talked of the old pioneer days,
but of this one winter they spoke but rarely.</p>
<p>&#8220;We lived alone with each other and God,&#8221; Virginia
said once. &#8220;He walked beside us on the prairie and made
our little sod house His sanctuary. Those were consecrated
days to Asher and me, like the stormy days of our
first love in the old war times, and the first hours of our
baby&#8217;s life. We were young and full of hope and belief in
the future, and we loved each other. But we had need to
have shoes of iron and brass, as Moses promised Asher of
old. It was a hard, hard way, but it was His way. I am
glad we walked through it all. It made the soil of Kansas
sacred to us two forevermore.&#8221;</p>
<p>One March day spring came up the Grass River Valley
with a glory all its own, and sky and headland and low
level prairie were baptized with a new life. A month later
a half-dozen prairie schooners moved out on the old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
sunflower-bordered trail. Then following down the Grass
River trail, the schooner folk saw that the land, which
Darley Champers had denounced, was very good. And for
Asher and Virginia Aydelot, the days of lonely solitude
were ended.</p>
<p>But the prairie had no gifts to bestow. It yielded
slowly to its possessors only after they had paid out time
and energy and hope and undying faith in its possibilities.
The little sum of money per acre turned over to the
Government represented the very least of the cost. There
were no forests to lay waste here, nor marshes to be drained.
Instead, forests must be grown and waters conserved.
What Francis Aydelot with the Clover Valley community
had struggled to overcome on the Ohio frontier, his
son, Asher, with other settlers now strove to develop
in Kansas. But these were young men, many of them
graduates, either in the North or the South, from a four
years&#8217; course in the University of the Civil War. No hardship
of the plains could be worse than the things they had
already endured. These men who held the plow handles
were State builders and they knew it. Into the State must
be builded schools and churches, roads and bridges, growing
timber and perpetual water reservoirs; while fields of grain
and orchard fruitage, and the product of flock and herd
must be multiplied as the sinews of life and larger opportunity.
For all these things the Kansas plains offered
to Asher Aydelot and his little company of neighbors only
land below, crossed by a grass-choked river, and sky overhead,
crossed but rarely by blessed rain-dropping clouds.
And yet the less the wilderness voluntarily gave up, the
more these farmer folk were determined to win from it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
Truly, they had need not only for large endurance in the
present, but for large vision of a future victory, and they
had both.</p>
<p>The weight of pioneer hardship, however, fell heaviest
on the women of whom Virginia Aydelot was a type. Into
the crucible out of which a state is moulded, she cast her
youth and strength and beauty; her love of luxury, her
need for common comforts, her joy in the cultured appointments
of society. She had a genius for music, trained in
the best schools of the East. And sometimes in the lonely
days, she marked her only table with a bit of charcoal to
the likeness of a keyboard. Then she set her music against
her clean dishpan and dumbly fingered the melodies she had
loved, hoping her hands might not lose all their cunning
in these years of home-making on the plains.</p>
<p>The spring of the memorable year of 1874 opened
auspiciously. The peach trees on the Aydelot and Shirley
claims bloomed for the first time; more sod had been
turned for wheat and corn; gardens and truck patches
were planted; cattle were grazing beyond the sand dunes
across the river, while the young cottonwood and catalpa
groves, less than three feet high it is true, began to make
great splotches of darker green on the prairie, promising
cool forest shade in coming years. Mail went west on
the main trail three times a week. The world was coming
nearer to the Grass River settlement which, in spite of his
doleful view once, Darley Champers was helping to fill up
to the profit of the real estate business.</p>
<p>Carey&#8217;s Crossing, having given up all hope of becoming
a county seat, had faded from the face of the earth. The
new county seat of Wolf County was confidently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
expected to be pitched at Wykerton, up in the Big Wolf
Creek settlement, where one Hans Wyker, former saloon-keeper
of Carey&#8217;s Crossing, was building up a brewery
for the downfall of the community. Dr. Carey was taking
an extended medical course in the East, whither Bo Peep
had followed him. Darley Champers was hovering like a
hawk between Wykerton and the Grass River settlement.
Todd Stewart had taken a claim, while John Jacobs, temporarily
in the East, was busy planting the seeds for a new
town which no Wyker brewery should despoil.</p>
<p>All lovely was this springtime of 1874. Midsummer
had another story to tell. A story of a wrathful sun in a
rainless sky above a parched land, swept for days together
by the searing south winds. In all the prairie there was
no spot of vivid green, no oasis in the desert of tawny
grasses and stunted brown cornstalks, and bare, hot stubble
wherefrom even the poor crop of straw had been chaffless
and mean.</p>
<p>On a Sabbath morning in late July, the little Grass
River schoolhouse was crowded, for Sabbath school was the
event of the week. It did not take a multitude to crowd
the sod-built temple of learning. Even with the infant
class out of doors in the shade, the class inside filled the
space. The minister school-teacher, Pryor Gaines, called
it the &#8220;old folks&#8217; class,&#8221; although there was not a person
over thirty-five years of age in the whole settlement.</p>
<p>Asher Aydelot was the superintendent, and Virginia took
care of the infant class. Jim Shirley led the singing, and
Pryor Gaines taught the &#8220;old folks.&#8221; He was the same
minister school-teacher who had sat at the table with Dr.
Carey and Todd Stewart and John Jacobs on the day that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
Thomas Smith ate his first meal at the Jacobs House. With
the passing of Carey&#8217;s Crossing, he had taken a homestead
claim on Grass River.</p>
<p>This morning the lesson was short, and the children,
finding the heat of the shade outside unbearable, were sitting
on the earth floor beside their parents. Nobody
seemed ready to go home.</p>
<p>&#8220;Times are getting worse every day,&#8221; one man observed.
&#8220;No rain since the tenth of May, and the prettiest stand
of wheat I ever saw, burned to a half-yield or less before
cutting time. I&#8217;d counted on wheat for my living this
year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same if you&#8217;d had corn, Bennington,&#8221; Jim
Shirley observed. &#8220;I was polishing my crown for a Corn
King Festival this fall. I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ll harvest fifteen
bushels to the acre.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fifteen bushels!&#8221; another neighbor exclaimed. &#8220;Fifteen
ears to the row a section long would encourage me,
Darley Champers told me when I took up my claim, if
I&#8217;d plant a grove or two, that in three years the trees
would be so big that rainfall would be abundant. You all
know my catalpa woods is a wonder,&#8221; he added with a wink.</p>
<p>Darley Champers himself had just come down the trail
and was entering the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, come over our way if you are on the hunt for
prosperity,&#8221; Todd Stewart interposed. &#8220;Grass River isn&#8217;t
living up to its name any better than our creek; isn&#8217;t
any fuller of weeds than our brook is of&mdash;shale. I did
lose the trail in your river this morning, though. The
weeds are nearly up to the pony&#8217;s flanks. Think of the
fertility of a river bed that will grow weeds three feet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
high and two shades more yellow green than the dead grass
on the bank. If there&#8217;s a drop of water in our creek for
twenty miles, I&#8217;d go get it and have Brother Gaines analyze
it to make sure it wasn&#8217;t resin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do well to see the humor of the situation, Stewart,&#8221;
Pryor Gaines began, with the cheery tone of a man who
believes in hope.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that that helps any,&#8221; Bennington, the first
speaker, broke in dolefully. &#8220;Joking isn&#8217;t going to give
us food and clothes and fuel till crop time comes again&mdash;if
it ever does.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not suffering for extra clothes. What I wear
now is a burden,&#8221; Todd Stewart declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, gentlemen.&#8221; Darley Champers took the floor.
&#8220;What are you going to do? That&#8217;s what brought me
here today. I knowed I&#8217;d find you all here. When I sent
some of you fellows into this blasted Sahara, I was honest.
I thought Grass River was a real stream, not a weed patch
and a stone outcrop. I&#8217;d seen water in it, as I can prove
by Aydelot. Remember, when we met down by the bend
here, one winter day?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I remember,&#8221; Asher replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I just come by there and there ain&#8217;t a drop of
water in that deep bend, no more&#8217;n in my hat.&#8221; Champers
plumped his hat down on the floor with the words. &#8220;And
the creek, on Stewart&#8217;s testimony, is a blasted fissure in the
earth.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I always said when that bend went dry, I&#8217;d leave the
country, but I can&#8217;t,&#8221; Jim Shirley said doggedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Champers inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I can&#8217;t throw away the only property I have in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
the world, and I haven&#8217;t the means to get away, let alone
start up anywhere else.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all in the same boat,&#8221; Bennington declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Same boat, every fellow rocking it, too, and no water
to drown in if we fall out. We&#8217;re in the queerest streak
of luck yet developed,&#8221; Todd Stewart observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take a vote, then, and see how many of us really
have no visible means of support and couldn&#8217;t walk out of
here at all. Let&#8217;s have a show of hands,&#8221; Jim Shirley
proposed.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you decide?&#8221; Champers asked, as the hands
dropped.</p>
<p>His eyes were on Asher Aydelot, who had not voted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you see? Everybody, except Asher there, is
nailed fast to the gumbo,&#8221; Stewart declared.</p>
<p>Darley Champers looked Asher Aydelot straight in the
eyes, and nobody could have said that pity or dislike or
surprise controlled the man&#8217;s mind, for something of all
three were in that look. Then he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, I know your condition just as well as you
do. You&#8217;re in a losing game, and it&#8217;s stay and starve, or&mdash;but
they ain&#8217;t no &#8217;or.&#8217; Now, I&#8217;ll advance money tomorrow
on every claim held here and take it and assume the mortgage.
Not that they are worth it. Oh, Lord, no. I&#8217;ll be
land-logged, and it&#8217;s out of kindness to you that I&#8217;m willin&#8217;
to stretch them fellers I represent in the East. But I&#8217;ll
take chances. I&#8217;ll help each feller of you to get away for
a reasonable price on your claim. It&#8217;s a humanitarian
move, but I may be able to lump it off for range land in
a few years for about what it costs to pay taxes. But,
gents, I got some of you in and I&#8217;m no scallawag when it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
comes to helpin&#8217; you out. Think it over, and I&#8217;ll be down
this way in two weeks. I&#8217;ve got to go now. It&#8217;s too
infernal hot to keep alive here. I know where there&#8217;s two
sunflower stalks up on the trail that&#8217;s fully two feet tall.
I&#8217;ve got to have shade. Goodday.&#8221; And Champers was
gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you say?&#8221; The question seemed to come
from all at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let Pryor Gaines speak first. He&#8217;s our preacher,&#8221;
Asher said with a smile.</p>
<p>Pryor Gaines was a small, fair-faced man, a scholar, a
dreamer, too, maybe. By birth or accident, he had suffered
from a deformity. He limped when he walked, and his
left hand had less than normal efficiency. On his face the
pathos of the large will and the limited power was written
over by the ready smile, the mark of abundant good will
toward men.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am out of the race,&#8221; he said calmly. &#8220;I&#8217;m as poor
as any of you, of course, and I must stay here anyhow,
Dr. Carey tells me. I came West on account of heart action
and some pulmonary necessities. I cannot choose where I
shall go, even if I had the means to carry out my choice.
But my necessities need not influence anyone,&#8221; he added
with a smile. &#8220;I can live without you, if I have to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about you?&#8221; Stewart said, turning to Asher.
&#8220;You take no risk at all in leaving, so you&#8217;ll go first, I
suppose?&#8221;</p>
<p>All this time the settlers&#8217; wives sat listening to the considerations
that meant so much to them. They wore calico
dresses, and not one of them had on a hat. But their sun-bonnets
were clean and stiffly starched, and, while they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
humbly clad, there was not a stupid face among them;
neither was their conversation stupid. Their homes and
home devices for improvement, the last reading in the
all too few papers that came their way, the memories of
books and lectures and college life of other days, and the
hope of the future, were among the things of which they
spoke.</p>
<p>Virginia Aydelot was no longer the pretty pink and
white girl-bride who had come to the West three years
before. Her face and arms were brown as a gypsy&#8217;s, but
her hair, rumpled by the white sunbonnet she had worn,
was abundant, and her dark eyes and the outlines of her
face had not changed. She would always be handsome
without regard to age or locality. Nor had the harshness
of the wilderness made harsh the soft Southern tongue that
was her heritage.</p>
<p>At Stewart&#8217;s words, Asher glanced at his wife, and he
knew from her eyes what her choice would be.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was a boy on the old farm back at Cloverdale,
Ohio, my mother&#8217;s advice was as useful to me as my
father&#8217;s.&#8221; Swift through Asher&#8217;s mind ran the memory of
that moonlit April night on his father&#8217;s veranda five
years before. &#8220;Out here it is our wives who bear the
heaviest burdens. Let us have their thoughts on the
situation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; Jim Shirley exclaimed. &#8220;Mrs. Aydelot,
you are first in point of time in this settlement. What do
you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big responsibility, Mrs. Aydelot,&#8221; Bennington,
who had not smiled hitherto, said with a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;As goes Asher Aydelot, so goes Grass River,&#8221; Todd
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
Stewart declared. &#8220;You speak for him, Mrs. Aydelot, and
tell us what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot tell <i>you</i> what to do. I can speak only for
the Aydelots,&#8221; Virginia said. &#8220;When we came West Asher
told me he had left one bridge not burned. He had put
aside enough money to take us back to Ohio and to start a
new life, on small dimensions, of course, back East, whenever
we found the prairies too hostile. They&#8217;ve often been
rough, never worse than now, but&#8221;&mdash;her eyes were bright
with the unconquerable will to do as she pleased, true
heritage of the Thaines of old&mdash;&#8220;but I&#8217;m not ready to
go yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim Shirley clapped his hands, but Pryor Gaines spoke
earnestly. &#8220;There is no failure in a land where the women
will to win. By them the hearthstones stand or crumble
to dust. The Plains are master now. They must be servant
some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Amen!&#8221; responded Asher Aydelot, and the Sabbath
service ended.</p>
<p>Two weeks later Darley Champers came again to the
barren valley and met the settlers in the sod schoolhouse.
Not a cloud had yet scarred the heavens, not a dewdrop had
glistened in the morning sunlight. Clearly, August was
outranking July as king of a season of glaring light and
withering heat. The settlers drooped listlessly on the backless
seats, and the barefoot children did not even try to
recite the golden text.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to speak to you, Aydelot,&#8221; Champers said at
the door, as the school service ended.</p>
<p>The two men sought the shady side of the cabin and
dropped on the ground.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to be plain, now, and you mustn&#8217;t misunderstand
me for a minute,&#8221; Champers declared. The blusterer
is rarely tactful.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Champers seemed to take the cheery tone as a personal
matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two weeks ago, I understand you and Mrs. Aydelot
headed off these poor devils from their one chance of
escape. Now, you know danged well you <i>don&#8217;t</i> intend to
stay here a minute longer&#8217;n it&#8217;ll take to kite out of this in
the fall. And you are sacrificing human lives by persuadin&#8217;
these folks to hold onto this land they just can&#8217;t
keep, nor make a livin&#8217; on, under five years and pay the
interest till their mortgages expire. And I&#8217;ve just this to
say:&#8221; Champers spoke persuasively. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a shark.
I&#8217;m humane. If you&#8217;ll help me to get these poor settlers
out of Grass River Valley, I&#8217;m willing to pay you a good
commission on every single claim and take no commission
at all on yours. It will help you a lot toward makin&#8217; a
bigger start back East. Don&#8217;t listen to your woman now;
listen to me, for I&#8217;m givin&#8217; you the chance of your life,
robbin&#8217; myself to do it, too. But&#8221;&mdash;his tone changed
abruptly&mdash;&#8220;if you figger you can take your danged
rainy-day bank account out&#8217;n the Cloverdale bank and grab
onto this land, you leave yourself, and hold onto it while
you stay East a few years, and then sneak back here and
get rich off their loss, I tell you now, you can&#8217;t do it. And
if you don&#8217;t use your influence right now to get &#8217;em to sell
out to my company, you&#8217;re going to regret it. Don&#8217;t ask
how I know. I <i>know</i>. I warn you once for all. You go
in there and help the men decide right now&mdash;I&#8217;ll buy at a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
reasonable figger, you understand&mdash;and you&#8217;re goin&#8217; to
help make &#8217;em sell to save their fool skins from starvation
and their wives and their little ones, or you&#8217;re going to rue
the day you drove into Kansas. What do you say? What
are you goin&#8217; to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s voice was full of menace, and he looked at
Asher Aydelot with the determination of one who will not
be thwarted.</p>
<p>Asher looked back at him with clear gray eyes that saw
deeper than the threatening words. A half smile hovered
about his lips as he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s your game, Darley Champers. If I&#8217;ll help
you to get hold of this land, you&#8217;ll pay the settlers more
than the claims are worth and you&#8217;ll pay me more than
they are worth. A pretty good price for worthless
ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, look at the landscape and tell me what you see.&#8221;
Darley Champers flung his hand out toward the sweep of
brown prairie with the dry river bed and the brazen sands
beyond it. Lean cattle stood disconsolately in the shadeless
open, while the cultivated fields were a mass of yellow
clods about the starveling crops.</p>
<p>Asher did not heed the interruption.</p>
<p>&#8220;You declare that I&#8217;ll leave here as soon as I can get
away, and that I&#8217;m brutal to use my influence to keep the
settlers here; that I am working a trick <i>you</i> have worked
out already for me, to get the land myself because it is
valuable; you, in your humane love for your fellowmen,
you threaten me with all unknown calamities if I refuse
your demand. And then you ask me what I have to say,
what I am going to do, and, with fine gestures, what I see?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Champers queried urgently.</p>
<p>The plains life made men patient and deliberate of
speech, and Asher did not hasten his words for all the
bluster.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say I am not using my influence to keep any man
here or push him out of here. I speak only for the family
at the Sunflower Inn. I know &#8217;danged well&#8217; I am not
going to leave the Grass River country this fall. Further,
I know your hand before you play it, and I know that if
you can play it against Todd Stewart and Jim Shirley and
Cyrus Bennington and the rest of them, I haven&#8217;t taken
their measure right. I know, again, that I am not afraid
of you, nor can any threat you make have an influence on
my action. And, lastly, as to what I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asher turned toward the west where the hot air quivered
between the iron earth and a sky of brass.</p>
<p>&#8220;I see a land fair as the garden of Eden, with grazing
herds on broad meadows, and fields on fields of wheat, and
groves and little lakes and rivers, a land of comfortable
homes and schools and churches&mdash;and no saloons nor
breweries.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see a danged fool,&#8221; Darley Champers cried, springing
up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come down here in twenty-five years and make a hunt
for me, then,&#8221; Asher said with a smile, but Champers had
already plunged inside the schoolhouse.</p>
<p>The council following was a brief one. Three or four
Grass River settlers agreed to give up the equity on their
claims of one hundred and sixty acres for enough money to
transport themselves and their families to their former
homes east of the Mississippi River. This decision left
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
only one child of all the little ones there, Todd Stewart,
a stubby little fellow, as much of a Scotchman as his fair-haired
father, who wound one arm about his father&#8217;s neck,
and whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t budge us, can they, dad?&#8221;</p>
<p>When the matter was concluded, Darley Champers rose
to his feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to say one thing,&#8221; he began doggedly. &#8220;I give
you the chance. Don&#8217;t never blame me because you are
too green to know what&#8217;s good for you. You are the only
green things here, though. And don&#8217;t forget, there ain&#8217;t
a man of you can get out of here on your own income or on
your own savin&#8217;s. Not a one. You&#8217;re all locked into this
valley an&#8217; the key&#8217;s in purgatory. An&#8217; I&#8217;d see you all with
the key before I&#8217;d ever lift a finger to help one of you,
and not a one of you can help yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>With these words Champers left the company and rode
away up the trail toward civilization and safety.</p>
<p>In the silence that followed, Pryor Gaines said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Friends, let us not forget that this is the Sabbath day
on the prairie as in the crowded city. Let us not leave
until we ask for His blessing in whose sight no sparrow
falls unnoticed.&#8221;</p>
<p>And together the little band of resolute men and women
offered prayer to Him whose is the earth and the fulness,
or the emptiness, thereof.</p>
<p>Four days and nights went by. On the fifth morning at
daybreak the cool breeze that sweeps the prairies in the
early dawn flowed caressingly along the Grass River valley.
The settlers rose early. This was the best part of the
day, and they made use of it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You poor Juno!&#8221; Virginia Aydelot said, as she leaned
against the corral post in the morning twilight, and patted
the mare gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;You and I are &#8217;plains-broke&#8217; for certain. We don&#8217;t
care for hot winds, nor cold winds, nor prairie fire, nor
even a hailstorm, if it would only come. Never mind, old
Juno, Asher has the greenest fields of all the valley because
he hasn&#8217;t stopped plowing. That&#8217;s why you must keep on
working. Maybe it will rain today, and you&#8217;ll get to rest.
Rain and rest!&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked toward the shadowy purple west, and then
away to the east, decked in the barbaric magnificence of
a plains sunrise.</p>
<p>&#8220;It may rain today, but it won&#8217;t rain rain. It will be
hot air and trouble. The sod shack is cool, anyhow, Juno.
Not so cool, though, as that little glen in the mountains
where the clear spring bubbles and babbles all day long.&#8221;
She brushed her hair back from her forehead and, squeezing
Juno&#8217;s mane, she added, &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to go back yet,
though. Not yet, do we, Juno, even if it rains trouble
instead of rain? Inherited pride and the will to do as we
please make us defy the plains, still.&#8221;</p>
<p>The day was exceedingly hot, but by noon a cloud
seemed rising in the northwest; not a glorious, black thunder-cloud
that means cool wind and sharp lightning and
a shower of longed-for rain. A yellow-gray cloud with
no deeper nor shallower tints to it, rising steadily, moving
swiftly, shut off the noonday glare. The shadows deepened
below this strange un-cloud-like cloud, not dark, but
dense. The few chickens in the settlement mistook the
clock and went to roost. At every settler&#8217;s house,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
wondering eyes watched the unheard-of phenomenon, so like, yet
utterly unlike, the sun&#8217;s eclipse.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, Asher,&#8221; Virginia exclaimed, as the two stood on
the low swell behind the house. &#8220;Listen to the roar, but
there&#8217;s no wind nor thunder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear that rasping edge to the rumble. It isn&#8217;t like
anything I ever knew,&#8221; Asher said, watching the coming
cloud intently.</p>
<p>From their height they could see it sweeping far across
the land, not high in the air, but beclouding the prairie like
a fog. Only this thing was dry and carried no cool breath
with it. Nearer it came, and the sun above looked wanly
through it, as surging, whipping, shimmering with silver
splinters of light, roaring with the whir of grating wings,
countless millions of grasshoppers filled the earth below and
the air above.</p>
<p>&#8220;The plague of Egypt,&#8221; Asher cried, and he and Virginia
retreated hastily before its force.</p>
<p>But they were not swift enough. The mosquito netting
across the open windows was eaten through and the hopping,
wriggling, flying pest surged inside. They smeared
greasily on the floor; they gnawed ravenously at every
bit of linen or cotton fabric; they fell into every open
vessel.</p>
<p>Truly, life may be made miserable in many ways, but in
the Kansas homes in that memorable grasshopper year of
1874 life was wretchedly uncomfortable. Out of doors the
cloud was a disaster. Nor flood, nor raging wind nor
prairie fire, nor unbroken drouth could claim greater measure
of havoc in its wake than this billion-footed, billion-winged
creature, an appetite grown measureless, a hunger
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
vitalized, and individualized, and endowed with power of
motion. No living shred of grass, or weed, or stalk of corn,
or straw of stubble or tiniest garden growth; no leaf or
bit of tender bark of tree, or shrub, escaped this many-mouthed
monster.</p>
<p>In the little peach orchard where there were a few half-ripe
peaches, the very first fruits of the orchards in this
untamed land, the hard peach stones, from which the meat
was eaten away, hung on their stems among the leafless
branches. The weed-grown bed of Grass River was swept
as by a prairie fire. And for the labor of the fields, nothing
remained. The cottonwood trees and wild plum bushes
belonged to a mid-winter landscape, and of the many young
catalpa groves, only stubby sticks stood up, making a
darker spot on the face of the bare plains.</p>
<p>For three days the Saint Bartholomew of vegetation continued.
Then the pest, still hungry, rose and passed to
the southeast, leaving behind it only a honey-combed soil
where eggs were deposited for future hatching, and a
famine-breeding desolation.</p>
<p>In days of great calamity or sorrow, sometimes little
things annoy strangely, and it is not until after the grief
has passed that the memory recalls and the mind wonders
why trifles should have had such power amid such vastly
important things. While the grasshopper was a burden,
one loss wore heavily on Virginia Aydelot&#8217;s mind. She had
given up hope for vines and daintier flowers in the early
summer, but one clump of coarse sunflowers she had tended
and watered and loved.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our flower,&#8221; she said to Asher, who laughed at her
care. &#8220;I won&#8217;t give them up. I can get along without the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
other blooms this year, but my sunflowers are my treasure
here&mdash;the only gold till the wheat turns yellow for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a sentimental sister,&#8221; Asher declared. But he
patiently carried water from the dwindling well supply to
keep the drouth from searing them. When they fell
before the ravenous grasshoppers, foolish as it was, Virginia
mourned their loss above the loss of crops&mdash;so
scanty were the joys of these women state builders.</p>
<p>The day after the pests left was the Sabbath. When
Asher Aydelot read the morning lesson in the Sunday
school, his voice was deep and unfaltering. He had chosen
the eighth chapter of Deuteronomy, with its sublime promises
to a wilderness-locked people.</p>
<p>Then Pryor Gaines offered prayer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although the figtree shall not blossom, neither shall
fruit be in the vines&#8221;&mdash;the old, old chant of Habakkuk
on Mount Shigionoth&mdash;&#8220;the labor of the olive shall fail,
and the fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut
off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:
yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my
salvation. The Lord God is my strength, and He will make
my feet like hind&#8217;s feet, and He will make me to walk upon
mine high places.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the scholarly man, crippled and held to the land,
prayed; and comfort came with his words.</p>
<p>Then Jim Shirley stood up to sing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m no preacher,&#8221; he said, holding the song book open
a moment, &#8220;but I do believe the Lord loves the fellow who
can laugh at his own hard luck. We weren&#8217;t so green as
Darley Champers tried to have us believe, because the hoppers
didn&#8217;t bite at us when they took every other green
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
and growing thing, and we have life enough in us to keep
on growing. Furthermore, we aren&#8217;t the only people that
have been pest-ridden. It&#8217;s even worse up on Big Wolf
Creek, where Wyker&#8217;s short on corn to feed his brewery
this fall. I&#8217;m going to ask everyone who is still glad he&#8217;s
in the Grass River settlement in Kansas to stand up and
sing just like he meant it. It&#8217;s the old Portuguese hymn.
Asher and I learned it back on Clover Creek in Ohio.</p>

<p>Every man and woman rose at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;The &#8216;ayes&#8217; have it,&#8221; Jim declared.</p>
<p>Then strong and sweet the song floated out across the
desolate drouth-ridden, pest-despoiled prairie. The same
song was sung that day, no doubt, where many worshipers
were met together. The same song, sung in country chapel
and city church; in mining villages, and in lonely lumber
camps; on vessels far out at sea, and in the missionary
service of distant heathen lands; by sick beds in humble
homes, and beneath the groined arches of the Old World
cathedrals.</p>
<p>But nowhere above the good green sod of Christendom
did it rise in braver, truer worship from trustful and unconquered
hearts than it rose that day in the little sod schoolhouse
on the Kansas prairie, pouring its melody down the
wide spaces of the Grass River Valley.</p>

<p>Pryor Gaines never preached a better sermon than
the one that followed the singing of that old Portuguese
hymn; and there were no doleful faces in that little
company when the service closed. The men stopped long
enough to discuss the best crops to put in for the fall,
and how and where they might get seeds for the same; to
consider ways for destroying the eggs left by the grasshoppers
in the honey-combed ground, and to trade help in
the wheat-breaking to begin the next day. The women lingered
to plan a picnic dinner for the coming Saturday.
Jim Shirley hummed an old love tune as he helped Pryor
Gaines to close the windows and door for the week. Only
little Todd Stewart, with sober face, scratched thoughtfully
at the hard earth with his hard little toes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t there be no more little children where there&#8217;s
grasshoppers and Darley Champerses?&#8221; he asked his
mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, Todd. You won&#8217;t be lonesome long,&#8221; his
mother assured him. &#8220;Some time when you are a man you
can say, &#8216;I was the only little boy the grasshoppers and
Darley Champers didn&#8217;t get.&#8217; You stout little Trojan!&#8221;</p>
<p>And then Todd, too, caught the spirit of the day and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
went singing blithely away. Across the bare hollow of
Grass River, and beyond the sand dunes into the brown
wastes that had been grassy prairies, his young voice came
trailing back still singing, as he rode behind his father, following
the long hot trail toward their home. And the
other settlers went their ways, each with courage renewed,
for the new week&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>Yet, they were lonesomely few in number, and the
prairies were vast; they were poverty-stricken, with little
means by which to sustain life through the coming season;
on every hand the desolate plains lay robbed of every
green growth, and to this land they were nailed hand and
foot as to a cross of crucifixion. But they were young.
They believed in the West and in themselves. Their faces
were set toward the future. They had voted themselves
into holding on, and, except for the Aydelots, no one family
had more resource than another. The Aydelots could
leave the West if they chose. But they did not choose. So
together they laughed at hardship; they made the most of
their meager possessions; they helped each other as one
family&mdash;and they trusted to Providence for the future.
And Providence, albeit she shows a seamy side to poverty,
still loves the man who laughs at hard luck. The seasons
following were not unkind. The late summer rains, the
long autumn, and the mild winter were blessings. But
withal, there were days on days of real hunger. Stock
died for lack of encouragement to live without food. And
the grim while of waiting for seed time and signs of prosperity
was lived through with that old Anglo-Saxon tenacity
that has led the English speaking peoples to fight and
colonize to the ends of the earth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Virginia,&#8221; Asher said one noontime, as the two sat
at their spare meal, &#8220;the folks are coming up tonight to
hold a council. I saw Bennington this morning and he
had heard from the men over Todd Stewart&#8217;s way. Dust
the piano, polish up the chandelier, and decorate with&mdash;smiles,&#8221;
he added, as he saw the shadow on his wife&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have the maid put the reception room in order,&#8221;
Virginia replied, with an attempt at merriment.</p>
<p>Then through the long afternoon she fought to a finish
with the yearning for the things she missed daily. At
supper time, however, she was the same cheery woman who
had laughed at loss and lack so often that she wondered
sometimes if abundance might not really make her sad.</p>
<p>In the evening the men sat on the ground about the door
of the Sunflower Inn. Their wives had not come with
them. One woman was sick at home; little Todd Stewart
was at the beginning of a fever, and the other women were
taking turns at nursing. Virginia&#8217;s turn had been the night
before. She was weary now and she sat in the doorway
listening to the men, and remembering how on just such
a moonlit September night she and Asher had sat together
under the Sign of the Sunflower and planned a future of
wealth and comfort.</p>
<p>&#8220;The case is desperate,&#8221; Cyrus Bennington was saying.
&#8220;Sickness and starvation and the horses failing every day
and the need for all the plowing and getting winter fuel.
Something must be done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others agreed, citing additional needs no less pressing.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are supplies and money coming from the East
right now,&#8221; Jim Shirley declared. &#8220;A hunting party
crossed south two days ago. I was down on lower Plum
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
Creek searching for firewood, and I met them. They said
we might get help from Wykerton if we went up right
away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you are Mr. Swift, Jim,&#8221; one of the men exclaimed.
&#8220;If you knew it two days ago, why in thunder
didn&#8217;t you report. We&#8217;d have made a wooden horse gallop
to Wykerton before night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d I round up the neighborhood? I didn&#8217;t get
home till nearly noon today. And, besides, they said Darley
Champers has the distributing of the supplies and money,
and he&#8217;s putting it where it will do the most good, not
giving to everybody alike, he says.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden blankness fell upon each face, as each recalled
the last words of Champers when he left them on the Sabbath
day in August.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you said a wooden horse could have galloped up
to Wykerton.&#8221; Jim Shirley tried to speak cheerfully. &#8220;A
horse of iron might, too, but who&#8217;s got a critter in Grass
River Valley right now that could make a trip like that?
Mine couldn&#8217;t. It took me two days and a half to haul up
a load of stuff, mostly sunflower stalks, that I gathered
down south.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aydelot&#8217;s black mare could do it if anything could,&#8221;
Pryor Gaines declared, trying to speak cheerfully, yet he
was the least able to meet the hardships of that season.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, maybe,&#8221; Shirley commented. &#8220;She&#8217;s a thoroughbred,
and they finally win, you know. But knowing what
you do, who of you wants to face Darley Champers?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again a hopeless despair filled the hearts of the little
company. Todd Stewart clinched his hands together. The
husband of the sick woman set his jaws like iron. Pryor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
Gaines turned his face away and offered no further word.
Asher Aydelot sat looking out across the prairie, touched
to silvery beauty by the pitying moonlight, and Jim Shirley
bowed his head and said nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go to Wykerton,&#8221; Virginia Aydelot&#8217;s soft voice
broke the silence. &#8220;I&#8217;ll take Juno and go tomorrow morning.
If Darley Champers refuses me, he would do the
same to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mrs. Aydelot, will you go? Can you try it? Do
you think you could do it?&#8221; The questions came from
the eager settlers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try it, Juno and I,&#8221; Virginia replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thoroughbreds, both of &#8217;em,&#8221; Jim Shirley murmured
under his breath, and Pryor Gaines&#8217; face expressed the
things he could not say.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that is the best thing to do,&#8221; Asher Aydelot
declared.</p>
<p>Then the settlers said good night, and sought their
homes.</p>
<p>As Virginia Aydelot rode away in the early morning, the
cool breeze came surging to her out of the west. The
plains were more barren than she had ever seen them before,
but the sky above them had lost nothing of its beauty. No
color had faded from the eastern horizon line, no magnificence
had slipped away from the sunset.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The heavens declare the glory of God,&#8217;&#8221; Virginia said
to herself. &#8220;Has He forgotten the earth which is His
also?&#8221;</p>
<p>She turned at the little swell to the northward to wave
good-by to Asher, standing with arms folded beside a corral
post, looking after her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Is he thinking of Cloverdale and the big cool farmhouse
and the well-kept farm, and the many people coming
and going along that old National pike road? He gave it
all up for me&mdash;all his inheritance for me and this.&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked back once more at the long slope of colorless
land and the solitary figure watching her in the midst
of it all.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell him tonight I&#8217;m ready to go back East. We
can go to Ohio, and Asher can live where his boyhood
days were spent. My Virginia can never be as it was in
my childhood, but Asher can have some of the pleasures
of his eastern home.&#8221; She pushed back the sunbonnet from
her face, and let the west breeze sweep across it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I used to wear a veil and was somewhat acquainted with
cold cream, and my hands were really white and soft. They
are hard and brown now. When I get home I&#8217;ll put it
straight to Asher about going back to civilization, even if
there are only a few dollars waiting to take us there, and
nothing waiting for us to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a sigh, half of anticipation and half of regret, she
rode away toward the little town of Wykerton in the Big
Wolf Creek settlement.</p>
<p>There were few differences between the new county seat
and Carey&#8217;s Crossing, except that there were a few more
houses, and over by the creek bank the brewery, by which
Hans Wyker proposed to save the West. There was,
however, one difference between the vanished Carey&#8217;s Crossing
and this place, the difference between the community
whose business leaders have ideals of citizenship, and the
community wherein commerce is advanced by the degradation
of its citizens. Wykerton had no Dr. Carey nor John
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
Jacobs to control it. The loafers stared boldly at Virginia
Aydelot as she rode up before the livery stable and
slipped from her saddle. Not because a woman in a calico
dress and sunbonnet, a tanned, brown-handed woman, was
a novelty there, but because the license of the place was
one of impudence and disrespect.</p>
<p>The saloon was on one side of the livery stable and the
postoffice was on the other side. Darley Champers&#8217; office
stood next to the postoffice, a dingy little shack with much
show of maps and real estate information. Behind the
office was a large barren yard where one little lilac bush
languished above the hard earth. The Wyker hotel and
store were across the street.</p>
<p>Virginia had been intrusted with small sums for sundry
purchases for the settlement, especially for the staple medicines
and household needs&mdash;camphor and turpentine, quinine
and certain cough syrups for the winter; castor oil,
some old and tried ointment, and brand of painkiller; thread
and needles and pins&mdash;especially pins&mdash;and buttons for
everybody&#8217;s clothes. One settler had ridden back at midnight
to ask for the purchase of a pair of shoes for his
wife. It was a precious commission that Virginia Aydelot
bore that day, although to the shopper in a Kansas city
today, the sum of money would have seemed pitifully small.</p>
<p>In the postoffice, printed rulings and directions regarding
the supplies were posted on the wall, and Virginia
read them carefully. Then with many misgivings and a
prayer for success, she crossed the street to Darley Champers&#8217;
place of business.</p>
<p>In spite of her plain dress, Virginia Aydelot was every
inch a lady, and Darley Champers, dull as he was in certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
lines, felt the difference her presence made in the atmosphere
of his office when she entered there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understood, Mr. Champers, that you have charge here
of the supplies sent into the state for the relief of those
who suffered from the grasshoppers,&#8221; she said, when she
was seated in the dingy little room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, mom!&#8221; Champers replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Mrs. Asher Aydelot, and I represent the Grass
River settlement. I have come to ask for a share of this
relief fund, and as I must start back as soon as possible
after dinner, perhaps we can make all arrangements
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>She never knew how near her gentle manner and pleasant
voice came to winning the day at once. Champers&#8217;
first impulse was to grant her anything she asked for; his
second was to refuse everything; his third, his ruling principle
always, was to negotiate to his own advantage. He
dropped his eyes and began to play for time.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know as I can help you at all, madam,&#8221; he said,
half sympathetically. &#8220;The supplies and money is about
gone, except what&#8217;s promised, and, well&mdash;you ought to
have come sooner. I&#8217;d a been glad to help you, but I
thought you Grass River folks had about everything you
needed for the winter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Champers,&#8221; Virginia cried, &#8220;you know that
nobody could foretell the coming of the plague. We were
as well off as hundreds of other settlers this dry summer
before the grasshoppers came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, madam, but the supplies is gone, about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you cannot promise that any more will be coming
soon?&#8221; The pathos of the woman&#8217;s voice was appealing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you could only understand how poor and how brave
those settlers are!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought your man had some little means to get you
and him away, if he&#8217;d use it that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sorrow of failure here and the suffering that must
follow it made Virginia sick at heart. A homesick longing
suddenly possessed her; a wish to get away from the country
and forget it altogether. And Champers was cunning
enough to understand.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d just like to get away from it, now, wouldn&#8217;t
you?&#8221; he asked persuasively.</p>
<p>&#8220;I surely would, when I think of the suffering there will
be,&#8221; Virginia replied. &#8220;Our staying won&#8217;t help matters
any.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit! Not a bit,&#8221; Champers asserted. &#8220;It&#8217;s too
bad you can&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia looked up wonderingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Madam, I haven&#8217;t no supplies. They&#8217;re all gone, I
think. But if you&#8217;ll come in right after dinner, I&#8217;ll see if
I can&#8217;t do something. I&#8217;m a humane man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be here at one o&#8217;clock,&#8221; she replied.</p>
<p>It was the last hope, and anything was better than utter
failure in her errand.</p>
<p>When she registered her name at the hotel for dinner,
Virginia&#8217;s eye was caught by the two names on the page.
Both belonged to strangers, but it was the sharp contrast of
the writing that made her read them. One recorded in a
cramped little hand the name of Thomas Smith, Wilmington,
Delaware. The other in big, even, backward slanting
letters spelled out the name of John Jacobs, Cincinnati,
Ohio.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span></p>
<p>The dining room was crowded with men when Virginia
entered. Whoever is hunting for evidence of good breeding
and unselfishness, must not expect too much in any
eating-house, be it dining car on the Empire Limited or
grub shack on the western frontier, if only men are accustomed
to feed there. The best places were filled with noisy
talkers and eaters, who stared at her indifferently, and it
was not until Gretchen Wyker, tow-haired, pimpled, and
short-necked like her father, chose to do so, that she finally
pointed out a chair at a shabby side table and waved her
empty tin waiter toward it. Virginia was passing the long
table of staring men to reach this seat, when a man rose
from the small table at the other side of the room and
crossed hastily to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me, madam,&#8221; he said politely. &#8220;Will you come
over to our table? We are strangers to you, but you will
get better service here than you might get alone. My
name is Jacobs. I saw you in the store this morning, and
I know nearly every man in your settlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a small service, truly, but to Virginia it was a
grateful one in that embarrassing moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can take Dr. Carey&#8217;s place. He&#8217;s away today,
locating a claim on the upper fork of Grass River somewhere.
He hasn&#8217;t been back a month, but he&#8217;s busy
as ever. Tell me about your neighborhood,&#8221; Jacobs
said.</p>
<p>Virginia told the story of the community that differed
little from the story of the whole frontier line of Kansas
settlements in the early seventies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you have hope of help through Mr. Champers?&#8221;
Jacobs asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what to hope for from Mr. Champers.
He seems kind-hearted,&#8221; Virginia replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will find him a real friend. He is pretty
busy with a man from the East today,&#8221; Jacobs answered,
with a face so neutral in its expression that Virginia wondered
what his thought might be.</p>
<p>As she rose to leave the table, Mr. Jacobs said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall be interested in knowing how you succeed this
afternoon. I hope you may not be disappointed. I happen
to know that there are funds and goods both on hand.
It&#8217;s a matter of getting them distributed without prejudice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are very kind, Mr. Jacobs,&#8221; Virginia replied. &#8220;It
is a desperate case. I feel as if I should be ready to leave
the West if I do not get relief for our neighborhood
today.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacobs looked at her keenly. &#8220;Can you go?&#8221; he asked.
&#8220;I wonder you have waited until now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never wanted to go before. I wouldn&#8217;t now. I
could stand it for our household.&#8221; The dark eyes flashed
with the old Thaine will to do as she pleased. &#8220;But it is
my sympathy for other people, for our sick, for discouraged
men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacobs smiled kindly and bowed as she left the room.</p>
<p>When she returned to Champers&#8217; office Mr. Thomas
Smith was already there, his small frame and narrow,
close-set eyes and secretive manner seeming out of place
in the breezy atmosphere of the plain, outspoken West of
the settlement days. In the conversation that followed it
seemed to Virginia that he controlled all of the real estate
dealer&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry to say that there ain&#8217;t anything left in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
way of supplies, Mrs. Aydelot, except what&#8217;s reserved for
worthy parties. I&#8217;ve looked over things carefully.&#8221; Darley
Champers broke the silence at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who draws the line between the worthy and the unworthy,
Mr. Champers?&#8221; Virginia asked. &#8220;I am told the
relief supply is not exhausted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the distributin&#8217;s in my hands in a way, but that
don&#8217;t change matters,&#8221; Champers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I read the rulings in the postoffice,&#8221; Virginia began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I had &#8217;em put there. It saves a lot of misunderstandin&#8217;,&#8221;
the guardian of supplies declared. &#8220;But it
don&#8217;t change anything here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia knew that her case was lost and she rose to
leave the room. She had instinctively distrusted Darley
Champers from their first meeting. She had disliked him
as an ill-bred, blustering sort of man, but she had not
thought him vindictive until now. Now she saw in him a
stubborn, unforgiving man, small enough to work out of
petty spite to the complete downfall of any who dared
oppose his plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Mrs. Aydelot. As I said this mornin&#8217;, it&#8217;s too
bad you can&#8217;t go back East now,&#8221; Champers said seriously.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can.&#8221; Virginia could not keep back the words.</p>
<p>Champers and Smith exchanged glances.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, mom, you can&#8217;t, Mrs. Aydelot. Let me show you
why.&#8221;</p>
<p>He opened the drawer of his rickety desk and out of a
mass of papers he fished up a copy of the <i>Cincinnati
Enquirer</i>, six weeks old. &#8220;Look at this,&#8221; and he thrust it
into Virginia&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>The head-lines were large, but the story was brief. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
failure of the Cloverdale bank, the disappearance of the
trusted cashier, the loss of deposits&mdash;a story too common to
need detail. Virginia Aydelot never knew until that moment
how much that reserve fund had really meant to her. She
had need of the inherited pride of the Thaines now.</p>
<p>&#8220;The papers are not always accurate,&#8221; she said quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, mom. But Mr. Smith here has interests in Cloverdale.
He&#8217;s just come from there, and he says it&#8217;s even
worse than this states it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia looked toward Mr. Smith, who nodded assent.</p>
<p>&#8220;The failure is complete. Fortunately, I lost but little,&#8221;
he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why hasn&#8217;t Mr. Aydelot been notified?&#8221; she demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It does seem queer he wasn&#8217;t,&#8221; Thomas Smith assented.</p>
<p>Something in his face made Virginia distrust him more
than she distrusted Darley Champers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, Mrs. Aydelot, seein&#8217; your last bridge is burned,
I&#8217;m humane enough to help you. You said this mornin&#8217;
you wanted to get away. Mr. Smith and I control some
funds together, and he&#8217;s willing to take Shirley&#8217;s place and
I&#8217;ll give you a reasonable figger, not quite so good as I
could &#8217;a done previous to this calamity&mdash;but I&#8217;ll take the
Aydelot place off your hands.&#8221; Champers smiled
triumphantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Aydelot place is not for sale. Good afternoon.&#8221;
And Virginia left the office without more words.</p>
<p>When she was gone Champers turned to Smith with a
growl.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s danged hard to turn agin a woman like her. What
made you so bitter?&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith half grinned and half snarled in reply:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, her neighbor, Shirley, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hopeless and crushed, Virginia sat down on the bench
before the Wyker House to wait for Juno to be brought to
her from the stables. The afternoon sun was beginning
to creep under the roof shading the doorway. Before her
the dusty street ran into the dusty trail leading out to the
colorless west. It was the saddest moment she had known in
the conflict with the wilderness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thy shoes shall be iron and brass,&#8221; ran the blessing of
Asher through her mind. &#8220;It must be true today as in
the desert long ago. And Asher lives by the memory of
his mother&#8217;s blessing.&#8221; The drooping shoulders lifted.
The dark eyes brightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t give up. I&#8217;m glad the money&#8217;s gone,&#8221; she
declared to herself. &#8220;We did depend on it so long as we
knew we had it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What luck, Mrs. Aydelot?&#8221; It was John Jacobs who
spoke as he sat down beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;All bad luck, but we are not discouraged,&#8221; she replied
bravely, and Jacobs read the whole story in the words.</p>
<p>A silence fell. Virginia sat looking at the vacant street,
while the young man studied her face. Then Juno was
brought to the door and Virginia rose to mount her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Aydelot,&#8221; John Jacob&#8217;s sharp eyes seemed to
pierce to her very soul as he said slowly, &#8220;I believe you are
not discouraged. You believe in this country, you, and
your neighbors. I believe in it, and I believe in you.
Stewart and I had to dissolve partnership when Carey&#8217;s
Crossing dissolved. He took a claim. It was all he could
do. I went back to Cincinnati, but only for a time. I&#8217;m
ready to start again. I will organize a company of town
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
builders, not brewery builders. You must not look for
favors in a whisky-ridden place like this. There&#8217;ll be no
saloon to rule our town.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia listened interestedly but not understandingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;What of this?&#8221; Jacobs continued. &#8220;I have some
means. I&#8217;m waiting for more. I&#8217;ll invest them in Grass
River. Go back and tell your homesteaders that I&#8217;ll make
a small five-year loan to every man in the settlement
according to his extreme needs. I&#8217;ll take each man&#8217;s note
with five per cent interest and the privilege of renewing for
two years if crops fail at the end of the term. I am
selfish, I&#8217;ll admit,&#8221; he declared, as Virginia looked at him
incredulously, &#8220;and I want dollar for dollar&mdash;always&mdash;sometimes
more. My people are popularly known as
Shylocks. But you note that my rate of usury is small,
the time long, and that I want these settlers to stay. I am
not trying to get rid of them in order to speculate on their
land in coming days of prosperity&mdash;the days when you
will be landlords over broad acres and I a merchant prince.
I say again, I believe in the West and in you farmer
people who must turn the West from a wilderness to a
land of plenty. I&#8217;m willing to risk something on your
venture.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Jacobs,&#8221; was all Virginia could say, and,
womanlike, the tears filled her eyes and ran down her
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell the men to send a committee up here with their
needs listed,&#8221; Jacobs said hastily, &#8220;or better, I&#8217;ll go out
there myself the day after tomorrow. I want to see what
kind of a claim Carey has preempted. Good-by, now,
good-by.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>He hurried Virginia to her horse and watched her ride
away.</p>
<p>Down at the ford of Wolf Creek the willow brush
fringed the main trail thinly for a little distance and half
hid the creek trail, winding up a long canyon-like hollow,
until a low place in the bank and a steep climb brought it
up to the open prairie. It was the same trail that Dr.
Carey had spoken of as belonging to an ugly little creek
running into Big Wolf, the trail he had wanted to avoid
on the day he had heard Virginia singing when she was
lost on the prairie one cold day.</p>
<p>Virginia paused in this semblance of shade to let Juno
drink. She pushed back her sunbonnet and sat waiting.
Her brown face grew radiant as she thought of the good
news she was bearing to the waiting home-makers of the
Grass River Valley. A song came to her lips, and as she
sang a soft little measure she remembered how somewhere
down a tributary to this very creek she had sung for help
in pleading tones one cold hopeless day three years before.
So intent was she on the triumph of the hour she did not
even look up the willow-shadowed creek trail.</p>
<p>Dr. Horace Carey, coming in from a distant claim, had
dropped into this trail for the bits of shade here and there
and was letting his pony take its way leisurely along the
side of the creek bed. There were only a few shallow pools
now where the fall rains would soon put a running stream,
and as the doctor&#8217;s way lay along the moist places the
pony&#8217;s feet fell noiselessly on the soft ground. As he
rounded a bend in the stream he caught sight of Virginia,
her face outlined against the background of willow sprays,
making a picture worth a journey to see, it was such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
hopeful, happy face at that moment. Dr. Carey involuntarily
checked his pony at the sight. His own countenance
was too pale for a Kansas plainsman, and he sat so still
that the low strain of Virginia&#8217;s song reached his ears.</p>
<p>Presently Juno lifted her head and Virginia rode away
out on the Sunflower Trail, bordered now only by dead
pest-ridden stalks. Suddenly lifting her eyes she saw far
across a stretch of burned prairie a landscape of exquisite
beauty. In a foreground lay a little lake surrounded by
grassy banks and behind it, on a slight elevation, stood a
mansion house of the old Colonial style with white pillared
portico, and green vines and forest trees casting cool shade.
Beyond it, wrapped in mist, rose a mountain height with a
road winding picturesquely in and out along its side.
Virginia caught her breath as a great sob rose in her
throat. This was all so like the old Thaine mansion house
of her childhood years.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only the mirage,&#8221; she said aloud. &#8220;But it was so
like&mdash;what?&#8221; She held Juno back as she looked afar at
the receding painting of the plains. &#8220;It&#8217;s like the house
we&#8217;ll have some day on that slope beyond the Sunflower
Inn. The mountains are misty. They are only the mountains
of memory. But the home and the woods and the
water&mdash;all may be real.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she thought of Asher and of the dull prairie
everywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if he would want to go back if he could see
this as I see it,&#8221; she questioned. &#8220;But I know he has seen
it daily. I can tell by that look in his gray eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was long after moonrise when Asher Aydelot, watching
by the corral, heard the sound of hoof-beats and saw
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
the faint outline of a horse and rider swinging in from the
northward as once before he had watched the same horse
and rider swinging over the same trail before the cool north
wind that beat back the September prairie fire.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have supper all ready. See what grew just for you!&#8221;
Asher said as he and his wife entered the house.</p>
<p>A bunch of forlorn little sunflowers in a brown pitcher
graced the table. They could scarcely be called flowers,
but to Virginia, who had hardly seen a blossom through the
days of drouth, the joy they brought was keener than the
joy that the roses and orchids gave in the days of a later
prosperity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I found them in the draw where the wild plums grow,&#8221;
Asher said. &#8220;How they ever escaped the hoppers is a
miracle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We will christen our claim &#8217;The Sunflower Ranch&#8217;
tonight, and these are our decorations for the ceremony.
It is all we have now. But it is ours,&#8221; Virginia declared.</p>
<p>And then she told the story of the bank failure at
Cloverdale.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last bridge is burned surely,&#8221; Asher commented
as he looked across the table at Virginia. &#8220;This is the
only property we have except youth and health and hope&mdash;and&mdash;each
other.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And the old Aydelot heritage to stand for principle,
and your mother&#8217;s belief in the West and in you, and the
Thaine stubbornness about giving up what they want to
keep,&#8221; Virginia declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;As our days so shall our strength be,&#8221; Asher added,
as he saw his wife&#8217;s face bright with hope and determination,
and remembered the sweet face of his mother as it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
had looked that night on the veranda of the old farmhouse
by the National pike road.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>For a long time down by the willows thinly shadowing
Wolf Creek a white-faced man sat looking out toward the
west, where a horse and rider had vanished into the mellow
tones of distance.</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Living by faith, which is the substance of things hoped
for, is good for the spirit but reducing to the flesh.
Yet it was much by faith that the frontier settlers lived
through the winter after the grasshopper raid. Jim
Shirley often declared in that time between crops that he
could make three meals a day on Pryor Gaines&#8217; smile. And
Todd Stewart asserted that when the meat was all gone
from their larder his family lived one whole week on John
Jacobs&#8217; belief in the future of their settlement. For the
hardship of that winter was heavy. All the more heavy
because the settlers were not stupid pauper-bred folk but
young men and women of intelligence and culture, whose
early lives had known luxuries as well as comforts. But
the saving sense of humor, the saving power of belief
in themselves, and the saving grace of brotherly love carried
them through.</p>
<p>The winter was mercifully mild and the short grass of
the prairies was nourishing to the stock that must
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
otherwise have perished. Late in February a rainfall began that
lasted for days and Grass River, rising to its opportunity,
drowned all the fords, so that the neighbors on widely separated
claims were cut off from each other. No telephones
relieved the loneliness of the country dwellers in those days,
and each household had to rely on its own resources for all
its needs. March came raging in like a lion. All the rain
turned to snow and the wind to a polar blast as the one
furious blizzard of that season fell upon the plains and for
many hours threshed the snow-covered land.</p>
<p>On the night before the coming of the blizzard the light
did not go out in the Aydelot cabin. And while the wind
and rain without raved at door and window, a faint little
cry within told that a new life had come to the world, a
baby girl born in the midst of the storm. Morning brought
no check to the furious elements. And Asher, who had
fought in the front line at Antietam, had forced his way
through a storm of Indian arrows out of a death-trap in
the foothills of the Rockies, had ministered to men on the
plains dying of the Asiatic plague, and had bound up the
wounds of men who returned to the battle again, found a
new form of heroism that morning in his own little cabin&mdash;the
heroism of motherhood.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must go for help, Asher,&#8221; Virginia said, smiling
bravely. &#8220;Leave the baby beside me here. We&#8217;ll wait till
you come back. Little Sweetheart, you are welcome, if you
did come with the storm, a little before you were expected.&#8221;
The young mother looked fondly at the tiny face beside
her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t leave you alone, Virgie,&#8221; Asher insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you must.&#8221; Virginia&#8217;s voice was full of courage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
&#8220;You can go as far as Pryor Gaines&#8217; and send him on for
you. Little daughter and I will be all right till you come
back.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Asher left her.</p>
<p>Pryor Gaines was waterbound across Grass River. Of
the three women living east of the stream one was sick
abed, one was kept at home with a sick husband, and the
third had gone with her husband to Wykerton for supplies
and was stormstaid somewhere along the Sunflower Trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must go for Jim. Any neighborhood is blessed that
has a few good-hearted unmarried folks in it,&#8221; Asher
thought as he braced himself against the driving rain and
hurried away.</p>
<p>When he reached home again the fire was low, the house
was very quiet, and Virginia&#8217;s face was white against her
pillow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our little daughter is asleep,&#8221; she said, and turning
away she seemed not to hear her husband&#8217;s voice assuring
her that Jim would bring the doctor as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The blizzard was just beginning in the early evening
when Jim Shirley fairly blew down the trail from the
north. He slipped into the kitchen and passed quietly to the
next room. Asher was bending over his wife, who lay in
a delirium.</p>
<p>Jim Shirley had one of those sympathetic natures that
read the joys and sorrows of their friends without words.
One look at Asher told him what had been.</p>
<p>&#8220;The doctor was away up Wolf Creek, but I left word
with his colored man for him to come at once, and he&#8217;ll
do it,&#8221; Jim assured Asher as he stood for a moment beside
the bed. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t wait because you need me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>Asher lifted his head and looked at Jim. As man to
man they knew as never before the strength of their lifetime
friendship.</p>
<p>&#8220;I need you. She needs the doctor. The baby&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t need any of us,&#8221; Jim said softly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do
what I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is no strange, unreal story of the wilderness day, this
fluttering in and out of a little life, where no rosewood
grew for coffins nor florists made broken columns of white
lilies and immortelles.</p>
<p>But no mother&#8217;s hands could have been more gentle than
the gentle hands of Jim Shirley as he prepared the little
form for burial.</p>
<p>Meantime the wind was at its wildest, and the plains
blizzard swirled in blinding bitterness along the prairie.
The hours of the night dragged by slowly to the two men
hoping for the doctor&#8217;s coming, yet fearing that hope was
impossible in the face of such a night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carey has the keenest sense of direction I ever knew
in a human being,&#8221; Jim assured Asher. &#8220;I know he will
not fail us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet the morning came and the doctor came not. The
day differed from the night only in the visible fierceness
of the storm. The wind swept howling in long angry
shrieks from the northwest. The snow seemed one dizzy,
maddening whirlpool of white flakes hanging forever above
the earth.</p>
<p>Inside the cabin Virginia&#8217;s delirium was turning to a
frenzy. And Asher and Jim forgot that somewhere in
the world that day there was warmth and sunlight, health
and happiness, flowers, and the song of birds, and babies
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
cooing on their mothers&#8217; knees. And the hours of the day
dragged on to evening.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Carey had come into Wykerton belated
by the rains.</p>
<p>&#8220;The wind is changing. There&#8217;ll be a snowstorm before
morning, Bo Peep,&#8221; he said wearily as the young colored
man assisted him into warm, dry clothes. &#8220;It&#8217;s glorious
to sit by a fire on a night like this. I didn&#8217;t know how
tired I was till now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, suh, I&#8217;se glad you all is home for the night, suh.
I sho&#8217; is. I got mighty little use for this yuh country.
I&#8217;se sorry now I eveh done taken my leave of ol&#8217; Virginny.&#8221;
Bo Peep&#8217;s white teeth glistened as he laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any calls while I was gone?&#8221; Dr. Carey asked.</p>
<p>Bo Peep pretended not to hear as he busied himself
over his employer&#8217;s wraps, until Carey repeated the
question.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, suh! no, suh! none that kaint wait till mawhnin&#8217;,
suh,&#8221; Bo Peep assured him, adding to himself, &#8220;Tiahd
as he is, he&#8217;s not gwine way out to Grass Riveh this blessed
night, not if I loses my job of bein&#8217; custodian of this huh
&#8217;stablishment. Not long&#8217;s my name&#8217;s Bone-ah-gees Peepehville,
no, suh!&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Carey settled down for the evening with some
inexplicable misgiving he could not overcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t sleep well last night, Bo Peep,&#8221; he said when
he rose late the next morning. &#8220;I reckon we doctors get
so used to being called out on especially bad nights we
can&#8217;t rest decently in our beds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t sleep well, nutheh,&#8221; Bo Peep replied. &#8220;I kep
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
thinkin&#8217; bout that man come heah foh you yestedy. I jes
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t gwine to le&#8217; yuh go out again las&#8217; night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What did he want?&#8221; the doctor asked, secretly appreciative
of Bo Peep&#8217;s goodness of heart as he saw the street
full of whirling snow.</p>
<p>&#8220;He done said hit wah a maturity case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bo Peep tried to speak carelessly. In truth, his conscience
had not left him in peace a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Who was it?&#8221; Horace Carey
demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be mad, Doctah, please don&#8217;t. Hit wah cuz you
all wah done woah out las&#8217; night. Hit wah Misteh Shulley
from Grass Riveh, suh. He said hit wah Misteh Asheh
Aydelot&#8217;s wife&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For the love of God!&#8221; Horace Carey cried hoarsely,
springing up. &#8220;Do you know who Mrs. Aydelot is, Bo
Peep?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, suh; neveh see huh.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was Virginia Thaine of the old Thaine family
back at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bo Peep did not sit down. He fell in a heap at Dr.
Carey&#8217;s feet, moaning grievously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fo&#8217; Gawd, I neveh thought o&#8217; harm. I jus&#8217; thought
o&#8217; you all, deed I did. Oh! Oh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Help to get me off then,&#8221; Carey commanded, and Bo
Peep flew to his tasks.</p>
<p>When the doctor was ready to start he found two horses
waiting outside in the storm and Bo Peep, wrapped to the
eyes, beside them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why two?&#8221; he asked kindly, for Bo Peep&#8217;s face was
so full of sorrow he could not help pitying the boy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Please, kaint I go with you all? I can cook betteh&#8217;n
Miss Virginia eveh could, an&#8217; I can be lots of help an&#8217; you
all&#8217;ll need help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s a stinger of a storm, Bo Peep,&#8221; the doctor
insisted, anxious to be off.</p>
<p>&#8220;Neveh mind! Neveh mind! Lemme go. I won&#8217;t complain
of no stom.&#8221; And the doctor let him go.</p>
<p>It was already dark at the Sunflower Ranch when the
two, after hours of battling with wind and snow and bitter
cold, reached the cabin door. Bo Peep, instead of giving
up early or hanging a dead weight on Dr. Carey&#8217;s hands,
as he had feared the boy might do, had been the more
hopeful of the two in all the journey. The hardship was
Bo Peep&#8217;s penance, and right merrily, after the nature of
a merry-hearted race, he took his punishment.</p>
<p>Jim Shirley, putting wood on the kitchen fire, bent low
as he heard the piteous moanings from the sick room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Lord, if you can work miracles work one now,&#8221;
he pleaded below his breath. &#8220;Bring help out of this
storm or give us sense to do the best for her. We need
her so, dear Lord. We need her so.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted his eyes to see Horace Carey between himself
and the bedroom door, slipping out of his snowy coat.
And beside him stood Bo Peep, helping him to get ready
for the sick room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know Miss Virginia back in the Souf, suh. I done
come to take keer of this kitchen depahtment. I know
jus&#8217; what she lak mos&#8217; suh,&#8221; Bo Peep said to Jim, who
had not moved nor spoken. &#8220;I&#8217;se Misteh Bone-ah-gees
Peepehville, an&#8217; I done live with Doctah Carey&#8217;s family all
mah life, suh, &#8217;cept a short time I spent in the Jacobs House
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
at Carey&#8217;s Crossing. I&#8217;se his custodian now, suh, and I
know a few things about the cookin&#8217; depahtment, suh.&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked the part, and Jim accepted him gladly.</p>
<p>It is given to some men to know the power of the healing
spirit. Dr. Carey was such a man. His presence controlled
the atmosphere of the place. There was balm
in his voice and in the touch of his hand as much as in his
medicines. To him his own calling was divine. Who shall
say that the hope and belief with which his few drugs were
ministered carried not equal power with them toward health
and wholeness?</p>
<p>When Virginia Aydelot had fallen asleep at last the doctor
came into the kitchen and sat down with the two
haggard men to whom his coming had brought unspeakable
solace.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can take comfort, Mr. Aydelot,&#8221; he said assuringly.
&#8220;Your wife has been well cared for. Hardly one
man in a thousand could do as well as you have done. I
wonder you never studied medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem confident of results, Doctor,&#8221; Asher said
gratefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have known the Thaine family all my life,&#8221; Horace
Carey said quietly. And Asher, whose mind was surged
with anxiety, did not even think to be surprised.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did not recognize each other when I found her
on the way to Carey&#8217;s Crossing three or four years ago,
and&mdash;I did not know she was married then.&#8221;</p>
<p>He sat a while in silence, looking at the window against
which the wind outside was whirling the snow. When he
spoke again his tone was hopeful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Aydelot has had a nervous shock. But she is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
young. She has a heritage of will power and good blood.
She will climb up rapidly with the coming on of spring.&#8221;</p>
<p>How strange it was to Asher Aydelot to listen to such
words! He had not slept for fifty hours. It had seemed
to him that the dreadful storm outside and sickness and
the presence of death within were to be unending, and that
in all the world Jim Shirley would henceforth be his only
friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;You both need sleep,&#8221; Carey was saying in a matter-of-fact
way. &#8220;Bo Peep will take care of things here, and I
will look after Mrs. Aydelot. You will attend to the burial
at the earliest possible time in order to save her any signs
of grieving. And you will not grieve either until you
have more time. And remember, Aydelot,&#8221; he put his
hand comfortingly on Asher&#8217;s shoulders. &#8220;Remember in
this affliction that your ambition may stake out claims and
set up houses, but it takes a baby&#8217;s hand to really anchor
the hearthstones. And sometimes it takes even more. It
needs a little grave as well. I understood from Shirley
that some financial loss last fall prevented you from going
back to Ohio. You wouldn&#8217;t leave Grass River now if you
could.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Carey&#8217;s face was magnetic in its earnestness, and
even in the sorrow of the moment Asher remembered that
he had known Virginia all her life and he wondered subconsciously
why the two had not fallen in love with each
other.</p>
<p>And so it was that as the Sunflower Inn had received
the first bride and groom to set up the first home in the
Grass River Valley, so the first baby born in the valley
opened its eyes to the light of day in the same Sunflower
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
Inn. And out of this sod cabin came the first form to its
burial. And it was the Sunflower Ranch that gave ground
for God&#8217;s Acre there for all the years that followed. It
happened, too, that as Jim Shirley had been the friendly
helper at that bridal supper and happy house-warming
more than three years ago, so now it was Jim Shirley
who in the hour of sorrow was the helper still.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The winter season passed with the passing of the blizzard.
The warm spring air was delicious and all the
prairies were presently abloom with a wild luxuriance of
flowers.</p>
<p>Asher carried Virginia to the sunshine at the west window
from which she could see the beautiful outdoor world.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t leave here now if we could,&#8221; she declared
as she beheld all the glory of the springtime rolling
away before her eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bank accounts bring comforts, but they do not make
all of life nor consecrate death. We have given our first-born
back to the prairie. It is sacred soil now,&#8221; Asher
replied.</p>
<p>And then they talked of many things, but mostly of
Dr. Carey.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have known him from childhood,&#8221; Virginia said. &#8220;He
was my very first sweetheart, as very first sweethearts go.
He went into the war when he was young. I didn&#8217;t know
much that happened after that. He was at home, I think,
when you were in that hospital where I first saw you, and&mdash;oh,
yes, Asher, dear, he was at home when your blessed
letter came, the one with the old greasy deuce of hearts and
the sunflower. It was this same Bo Peep, Carey&#8217;s boy,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
who brought it to me up in the glen behind the big house.
Horace left Virginia just after that.&#8221; Virginia closed her
eyes and lived in the past again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder you never cared for Dr. Carey, Virgie. He
is a prince among men,&#8221; Asher said, as he leaned over
her chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I might, if my king had not sent me that sunflower
just then. It made a new world for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am only a common farmer, Virgie, just a king
of a Kansas claim, just a home-builder on the prairie,&#8221;
Asher insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Asher, if you had your choice this minute of all the
things you might be, what would you choose to be?&#8221;
Virginia asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a common farmer, just a king of a Kansas claim,&#8221;
Asher replied. Then looking out toward the swell of
ground beside the Grass River schoolhouse where the one
little mound of green earth marked his first-born&#8217;s grave, he
added, &#8220;Just a home-builder on the prairies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second generation of grasshoppers tarried but
briefly, then all together took wing and flew away, no man
knew, nor cared, whither. And the Grass River settlers who
had weathered the hurricane of adversity, poor, but patient
and persistent still, planted, sometimes in tears to reap in
joy, sometimes in hope to reap only in heartsick hope
deferred, but failed not to keep on planting. Other settlers
came rapidly and the neighborhood thickened and
broadened. And so, amid hardships still, and lack of
opportunity and absence of many elements of culture, a
sturdy, independent, God-fearing people struggled with
the soil, while they lifted up faces full of hope and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
determination to the skies above them. What of the prairies
they could subdue they bent to their service. What they
could not overcome they defied the right to overcome them.
There were no lines of social caste. They were needy or
full together. They shared their pleasures; together they
laughed at calamities; and they comforted one another in
every sorrow.</p>
<p>A new town was platted on the claim that Dr. Carey
had preempted where the upper fork of Grass River crossed
the old Sunflower trail. The town founders ruled Hans
Wyker out of a membership among them. Moreover, they
declared their intentions of forever beating back all efforts
at saloon building within the corporation&#8217;s limits, making
Wykerton their sworn enemy for all time. In the new
town, which was a ten-by-ten shack of vertical boards, a
sod stable, and two dugout homes, the very first sale of
lots, for cash, too, was made to Darley Champers &amp; Co.,
dealers in real estate, mortgages, loans, etc.</p>
<p>One summer Sabbath afternoon, three years after the
grasshopper raid of dreadful memory, Asher came again
to the little grave in the Grass River graveyard where other
graves were consecrating the valley in other hearts. This
time he bore in his arms a dimpled, brown-eyed baby
boy who cooed and smiled as only babies can and flung
his little square fists aimlessly about in baby joy of
living.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll wait here, Thaine, till your mother comes from
Bennington&#8217;s to tell us about the little baby that just came
to our settlement only two days ago and staked out a claim
in a lot of hearts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little Thaine had found that his fist and his mouth
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
belonged together, so he offered no comment. Asher sat
down on the warm sod with the baby on his knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is your little sister&#8217;s grave, Thaine. She staid
with us less than a day, but we loved her then and we love
her still. Her name was to have been Mercy Pennington
Aydelot, after the sweet Quaker girl your two great-great-grandfathers
both loved. Such a big name for such a tiny
girl! She isn&#8217;t here, Thaine. This is just the little sod
house she holds as her claim. She is in a beautiful mansion
now. But she binds us always to the Grass River Valley
because she has a claim here. We couldn&#8217;t bear to go
away and leave her little holding. And now you&#8217;ve come
and all the big piece of prairie soil that is your papa&#8217;s
and mamma&#8217;s now will be yours some day. I hope you&#8217;ll
want to stay here.&#8221;</p>
<p>A stab of pain thrust him deeply as he remembered his
own father and understood for the first time what Francis
Aydelot must have felt for him. And then he remembered
his mother&#8217;s sacrifice and breadth of view.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Thaine, will you want to leave us some day?&#8221; he
said softly, gazing down into the baby&#8217;s big dark eyes.
&#8220;Heaven give me breadth and courage and memory, too,&#8221;
he added, &#8220;when that time comes not to be unkind; but to
be brave to let you go. Only, Thaine, there&#8217;s no bigger
place to go than to a big, fine Kansas farm. Oh! we fathers
are all alike. What Clover Creek was to Francis Aydelot,
Grass River is to me. Will it be given to you to see bigger
things?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine Aydelot crowed and stretched his little legs and
threw out his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine, there are no bigger things than the gifts of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
the soil. I may only win it, but you can find its hundredfold
of increase. See, yonder comes your mother. Not
the pretty, dainty Virginia girl I brought here as my
bride. But I tell you truly, baby boy, she will always be
handsome, because&mdash;you wouldn&#8217;t understand if I told
you, but you will some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Asher, the new baby is splendid, and Mrs. Bennington
is ever so well,&#8221; Virginia said, coming up to where
he sat waiting for her. &#8220;They call her Josephine after
Mr. Bennington&#8217;s mother. Thaine will never be lonely
here, as we have been. After all, it is not the little graves
alone that anchor us anywhere, for we can take memory
with us wherever we go; it is the children living, as well,
that hold our hearthstones fast and build a real community,
even in a wilderness. We are just ready to begin now.
The real story of the prairie is the story of the second
generation. The real romance out here will be Thaine
Aydelot&#8217;s romance, for he was born here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hans Wyker had managed skillfully when he pulled
the prospective county seat of Wolf county up
Big Wolf Creek to Wykerton, a town he hoped to build
after his own ideals. And his ideals had only one symbol,
namely, the dollar sign. Hans had congratulated himself
not a little over his success.</p>
<p>&#8220;I done it all mineself,&#8221; he was wont to boast. &#8220;So long
as Doc Carey tink he own der town vots name for him, an&#8217;
so long as Yon Yacob, der ding-busted little Chew, tink
him an&#8217; Todd Stewart run all der pusiness mitout regardin&#8217;
my saloon pusiness, an&#8217; so long as Pryor Gaines preachin&#8217;
an&#8217; teachin&#8217; all time gifin&#8217; black eye to me, &#8217;cause I sells
wisky, I not mak no hetway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are danged right,&#8221; Darley Champers would
always assure him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yah, I be. But von day I pull a lot of strinks at vonce.
I pull der county seat locate to Pig Wolf Creek, an&#8217; I put
up mine prewery here mit water power here vot dey
vassent not at Carey&#8217;s Crossing. An&#8217; der railroat comin&#8217;
by dis way soon, I know. I do big business two times in
vonce. I laugh yet to tink how easy Yon Yacob fall down.
If Yon Yacob say so he hold Carey&#8217;s for der county seat.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
But no. He yust sit shut oop like ant neffer say von sinkle
vord. An&#8217; here she coom&mdash;my prewery, my saloon, my
county seat, an&#8217; all in vonce.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hans would laugh till the tears ran down his rough red
cheeks. Then blowing his nose like a blast against the
walls of Jericho he would add:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yon Yacob go back to Cincinnati. Doc Carey, he
come Vest an&#8217; locate again right here. Course he tak up
claim on nort fork of Grass River. But dat&#8217;s yust for
speculation some yet. Gaines an&#8217; Stewart go to Grass River
settlement an&#8217; homestead. Oh, I scatter &#8217;em like chaffs.
Ho! Ho!&#8221; And again the laughter would bring tears to
his watery little white-gray eyes.</p>
<p>What Hans Wyker said of John Jacobs was true, for
in the council that decided the fate of the town it was his
silence that lost the day and put Carey&#8217;s Crossing off the
map. Hans, while rejoicing over the result, openly accused
Jacobs of being a ding-busted, selfish Jew who cared for
nobody but John Jacobs. Secretly Hans admired Jacobs
for his business ability, and all men respected him for a
gentleman. Hence it was no small disappointment to the
brewery owner to find when Jacobs returned to Kansas that
he did not mean to open a business in Wykerton. Instead,
he loaned his money to Grass River homesteaders.</p>
<p>When crops began to bring returns Jacobs established
a new town farther west on the claim that Dr. Carey had
taken up. Jacobs insisted on calling the place Careyville
in honor of the doctor, because he had been the means of
annihilating the first town named after Carey. And since
he had befriended the settlers in the days after the grasshopper
raid he drew all the trade west of Big Wolf to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
this new town, cutting deep into the Wykerton business.
Misfortunes hunt in couples when they do not gather in
larger companies. Not only did the Jacobs store decrease
the income of the Wykerton stores, but, following hard
after, came the shifting of county lines. Wolf county
fell into three sections, to increase three other counties.
The least desirable ground lay in the north section, and
the town built up on a brewery and the hopes of being hit
by a railroad survey, and of holding the county seat, was
left in this third part which, like Caesar&#8217;s third part of all
Gaul, was most barbarous because least often the refining
influences of civilization found their way thither.</p>
<p>Then came the crushing calamity, the Prohibitory Law,
which put Hans Wyker out of business. And hand in
hand with this disaster, when the railroad came at last it
drove its steel lines imperiously westward, ignoring Wykerton,
with the ugly little canyons of Big Wolf on the north,
and the site of Carey&#8217;s Crossing beside the old blossom-bordered
trail on the south. Finding the new town of
Careyville a strategic point, it headed straight thither,
built through it, marked it for a future division point, and
forged onward toward the sunset.</p>
<p>Dr. Carey had located an office on his claim when there
were only four other buildings on the Careyville townsite.
Darley Champers opened a branch office there about the
same time, although he did not leave Wykerton. But the
downfall of Wyker and his interests cut deeper into the
interests of the Grass River settlement than anyone dreamed
of at the time. It sifted into Wyker&#8217;s slow brain that the
Jew, as he called Jacobs with many profane decorations,
had been shrewd as well as selfish when his silent vote had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
given Wykerton the lead in the race for a county seat
location.</p>
<p>&#8220;Infernal scoundrel,&#8221; Hans would cry with many gestures,
&#8220;he figger it out in his own little black het and neffer
tell nobody, so. He know to hisself dat Carey&#8217;s Crossing&#8217;s
too fur sout, so&mdash;an&#8217; Big Wolf Creek too fur nort, so.&#8221;
Hands wide apart, and eyes red with anger. &#8220;He know
der survey go between like it, so! And he figger it hit yust
fer it hit Grass River, nort fork. An&#8217; he make a townsite
dere, yust where Doc Carey take oop. Devil take him!
An&#8217; he pull all my town&#8217;s trade mit his fat pocketbook, huh!
I send Champers to puy all Grass River claims. Dey don&#8217;t
sell none. I say, &#8216;Champers, let &#8217;em starf.&#8217; Den Champers,
he let &#8217;em. When supplies for crasshopper sufferers
cooms from East we lock &#8217;em oop in der office, tight. An&#8217;
ve sell &#8217;em. Huh! Cooms Yon Yacob an&#8217; he loan claim-holters
money&mdash;fife per cent, huh! Puy &#8217;em, hide an&#8217;
hoof, an&#8217; horn, an&#8217; tail! Dey all swear py Yon Yacob.
He rop me. I fix him yet sometime. I hate Yon Yacob!&#8221;</p>
<p>And Hans Wyker&#8217;s hate was slow, but it was incurably
poison.</p>
<p>One morning in early autumn Dr. Horace Carey drove
leisurely down the street of the town that bore his name.
The air was crisp and invigorating, for the September
heat had just been broken by copious showers. Todd
Stewart stood in the doorway of Jacobs&#8217; store, watching the
doctor&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Doctor,&#8221; he called. &#8220;Somebody dying
or a highwayman chasing after you for your pocketbook,
that you drive so furiously?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Stewart. No, nobody is in danger.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
Can&#8217;t a doctor enjoy life once in a while? The country&#8217;s
so disgustingly healthy I have to make the best of it and
kill time some way. Come, help at the killing, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
Carey drew rein before the door of the store.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t do it, Carey. Jacobs is away up on Big
Wolf appraising some land and I want to be here when
he comes in. I must do some holding up myself pretty
soon if things don&#8217;t pick up after this hot summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re an asset to the community, to be growling like
that with this year&#8217;s crops fairly choking the market,&#8221;
Horace Carey declared.</p>
<p>With a good-by wave of his hand he turned his horses&#8217;
heads toward the south and took his way past the grain
elevator toward the railroad crossing. The morning train
was just pulling up to the station, blocking the street, so
Carey sat still watching it with that interest a great locomotive
in motion always holds for thinking people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Papa, there&#8217;s Doctor Carey,&#8221; a child&#8217;s voice cried, and
Thaine Aydelot bounded across the platform toward him,
followed by his less-excited father.</p>
<p>Thaine was a sturdy, sun-browned little fellow of seven
years, with blooming cheeks and big dark eyes. He was
rather under than over normal size, and in the simplicity of
plains life he had still the innocence of the very little boy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Thaine. Good morning, Aydelot. Are
you just getting home? Let me take you out. I&#8217;m going
your way myself,&#8221; Dr. Carey said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning. Yes, we are getting home a little
earlier than we were expected and nobody is here to meet
us. We&#8217;ll be glad to ride out with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asher lifted Thaine into the buggy with the words. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
certain reserve between the two men had never been
broken, although they respected each other deeply and
were fast friends.</p>
<p>The train cleared the crossing and the three went south
over the bridge across the dry North Fork Creek, beyond
the cattle pens, and on to the open country leading out
toward the Grass River Valley. The morning was glorious
with silvery mists lifting along the river&#8217;s course and a
shimmering light above golden stubble and brown plowed
land and level prairie; while far away, in all its beauty,
hung the deep purple veil that Nature drops between her
finite and her infinite, where the things that are seen melt
into the things that are not seen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take the lines, Aydelot, and let me visit with Thaine,&#8221;
Horace Carey said, giving Asher the reins.</p>
<p>He was fond of children and children were more than
fond of him. Thaine idolized him and snuggled up in his
lap now with complete contentment of soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me all about it now, Thaine. Where have you
been so long? I might have missed you down on the
Sunflower Ranch this morning if I had driven faster and
headed off the through train as it came in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oo-o!&#8221; Thaine groaned at the possible disaster to
himself. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been to Topeka, a very long way off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you saw so many fine things?&#8221; Carey questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a big, awful big river. And a bridge made of
iron. And it just rattled when we went across. And there
were big pieces of the Statehouse lying around in the tall
weeds. And such greeny green grass just <i>everywhere</i>.
And, and, oh, the biggest trees. So many, all close
together. Papa said it was like Ohio. Oh, so big. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
never knew trees could grow so big, nor so many of them
all together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Little Thaine spread his short arms to show how wondrous
large these trees were.</p>
<p>&#8220;He has never seen a tree before that was more than
three inches through, except two or three lonesome cottonwoods.
The forests of his grandfather&#8217;s farm in Ohio
would be gigantic to him. How little the prairie children
know of the world!&#8221; Asher declared.</p>
<p>Dr. Carey remembered what Jim Shirley had told him
of that lost estate in Ohio, and refrained from comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d like to live in Topeka where the big Kaw river
is, and the big trees along its banks, and so much green
grass, wouldn&#8217;t you, Thaine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; The child&#8217;s face was quaintly contemptuous.
&#8220;It&#8217;s too&mdash;too choky.&#8221; The little hand clutched at the
fat brown throat. &#8220;And the grass is so mussy green, and
you can&#8217;t <i>see</i> to <i>any</i>where for the bumpy hills and things.
I like our old brown prairies best. It&#8217;s so&mdash;nice out
here.&#8221; And with a sigh of perfect satisfaction Thaine
leaned against Dr. Carey&#8217;s shoulder and gazed out at the
wide landscape swathed in the early morning sunlight.</p>
<p>The two men exchanged glances.</p>
<p>&#8220;This will be the land of memory for him some day, as
you look back to the mountains of Virginia and I to the
woodlands of Ohio,&#8221; Asher said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is worth remembering, anyhow,&#8221; Carey replied. &#8220;I
can count twenty young windbreaks from the swell just
ahead, and the groves are springing up on many ranches
from year to year. Your grove is the finest in the valley
now, Aydelot.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is doing well,&#8221; Asher said. &#8220;Mrs. Aydelot and I
planned our home-to-be on the first evening we came to the
Sunflower Inn. It was a sort of mirage-of-the-desert picture,
it is true, but we were like the tapestry weavers. We
hung the pattern up before our eyes and worked to it. It
is slow weaving, I&#8217;ll admit, but we kept on because we
wanted to at first, then because we had to, and finally
because our hearts took root in a baby&#8217;s grave. They
say the tapestry makers work on the wrong side of the
threads, but when their work is done the pattern comes
out complete. I hope ours will too. But there&#8217;s many a
day of aching muscles, and many a day of disappointment
along the way. Crops prosper and crops fail, but we
can&#8217;t let the soil go untilled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we are all tapestry weavers. The trouble is
sometimes in the pattern we hang up before us and sometimes
in the careless weaving,&#8221; Dr. Carey added.</p>
<p>They rode a while in silence. The doctor&#8217;s cheek was
against Thaine&#8217;s dark hair and Asher looked down at his
hard brown hands and then away at the autumn prairie.</p>
<p>Fifteen years on a plains claim, with all the daily grind
of sowing and reaping and care of stock and garden, had
not taken quite all the military bearing from him. He
was thirty-eight years old now, vigorous and wholesome and
hopeful. The tanning Kansas sunshine had not hidden
the old expression of patience and endurance, nor had the
sight of many hardships driven the vision from the clear,
far-seeing gray eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the sunflowers, Papa,&#8221; Thaine cried as a curve
of the trail brought a long golden line to view.</p>
<p>&#8220;You like the sunflowers, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; Carey asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, better than all the flowers on the prairie. My
mamma loves them, too, because they made her think once
papa wasn&#8217;t dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine, what do you mean to do when you grow up?&#8221;
Horace Carey interrupted the child.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to be a soldier like my papa was,&#8221; Thaine
declared decisively.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there will probably be no wars. You see, your
papa and I fought the battles all through and settled
things. Maybe you can&#8217;t go to war,&#8221; Dr. Carey suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I can. There&#8217;ll be another war by that time,
and I&#8217;m going, too. And when I come back I&#8217;m going
away to where the purple notches are and have a big ranch
and do just like my papa,&#8221; Thaine asserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the purple notches?&#8221; the doctor asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;See yonder, away, way off?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine pointed toward the misty southwest horizon
where three darker curves were outlined against a background
of pale purple blending through lilac up to silvery
gray.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going there some day,&#8221; the boy insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;And leave your papa and mamma?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They left their papas and mammas, too,&#8221; Thaine
philosophized.</p>
<p>The men laughed, although each felt a curious deep
pain at the boy&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>Thaine settled back, satisfied to be silent as he watched
the wonderful prairie landscape about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going down to Shirley&#8217;s,&#8221; Carey began, as if to
change the subject. &#8220;Strange fellow, Jim; I never knew
another like him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I was just thinking of Shirley,&#8221; Asher responded.
&#8220;He is a royal neighbor and true friend, better to everybody
else than he is to himself. His own crops suffer sometimes
while he helps other folks lay theirs by. And yet
his premises always look like he was expecting company.
One cannot help wondering what purpose stays him in his
work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is the tragedy of it,&#8221; Horace Carey declared.
&#8220;I never knew a more affectionate man, yet he has lived
a bachelor all these years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you known him, Carey?&#8221; Asher asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since the night at Kelley&#8217;s Ferry, back in the Civil
War. Our regiment, the Fifty-fourth Virginia, was taken.
We were worn out with fighting and marching, and we
were nearly starved besides. The Third Ohio boys had
been in the same fix once and our boys&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was a Third Ohio boy. I know what you fellows
did. You saved our lives,&#8221; Asher broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you paid us back at Kelley&#8217;s Ferry. I first knew
Jim Shirley that night, although he remembered me from
the time we had your regiment at our mercy. He brought
me bacon and hard tack and coffee. We have been friends
ever since. How long have you known him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to war when I get big, before I ever go to
the purple notches. I know I am.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine had been listening intently and now he broke
in with face aglow and eyes full of eagerness.</p>
<p>&#8220;God forbid!&#8221; Carey said. &#8220;The lure of the drum beat
might be hard for older men to resist even now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your hand will fit a plow handle better than a gun-stock,
Thaine,&#8221; his father assured him, looking down at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
the boy&#8217;s square, sun-browned hand with a dimple in each
knuckle.</p>
<p>Thaine shut his lips tightly and said no more. But his
father, who knew the heart of a boy, wondered what
thoughts might lie back of that silence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have known Jim all my life,&#8221; Asher Aydelot took
up the conversation where Thaine had interrupted it.
&#8220;That is why I have wondered at the tenacity of his holding
on out here. A man of his temperament is prone to
let go quickly. Besides, Jim is far from being a strong
man physically.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When he was down with pneumonia in the early seventies
he was ready to give up. Didn&#8217;t want to get well and
was bound not to do it,&#8221; Dr. Carey said, &#8220;but somehow a
letter I had brought him seemed to change him with one
reading. &#8216;I will do anything to get back to strength and
work,&#8217; he declared, and he has worked ever since like a man
who knew his business, even if his business judgment is
sometimes faulty.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode awhile in silence, drinking in the delicious air
of early autumn. Presently Dr. Carey said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Aydelot, I am taking a letter down to Jim this morning.
It is in the same handwriting as the one I took when he
had the pneumonia so severely. I learned a little something
of Jim&#8217;s affairs through friends when I was East studying
some years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused for a moment. Then, as if to change the
subject, he continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, there was a bank failure at Cloverdale
once that interested you. Did you ever investigate it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There was nothing to investigate,&#8221; Asher replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>It did not occur to him to connect the query with Carey&#8217;s
knowledge of Shirley&#8217;s affairs or with his studying in the
East.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have relatives there?&#8221; Carey asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a Jane Aydelot. Married, single, widowed, I can&#8217;t
tell. My father left his estate to her. I was in love with
the West then, and madly in love with my wife. My
father wasn&#8217;t impressed with either one. But, you see, I
was rash about little things like money matters. I had so
much faith in myself and I couldn&#8217;t give up a girl like
Virginia Thaine. Understand, I have no quarrel with Jane
Aydelot. Her property is absolutely her own, not mine
to crave and look forward to getting some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; Horace Carey said, looking out toward
the purple notches now more clearly outlined against the
sky. &#8220;How this country has changed since that cold day
when Mrs. Aydelot came almost to the old Crossing after
me. The sand dunes narrow and the river deepens a little
every year. The towns come and go on the prairies, but
the homesteaders build better. It is the farmer who really
makes a new country habitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what my mother said when I talked of coming
West. But the real test will come with the second generation.
If it is loyal we will have won. Here is the old
Grass River trail that Jim and I followed many lonely
days. The valley is slowly coming out of the wilderness,&#8221;
Asher replied, remembering his wife&#8217;s words long before
when she said: &#8220;The real story of the plains is the story
of the second generation. The real romance out here will
be Thaine Aydelot&#8217;s romance.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had reached the old trail that led to the Grass River
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
settlement now. It was still a new country where few trees,
save some lone cottonwoods, were as tall as a cabin, and
nothing broke the view. But groves had rooted, low windbreaks
cut the country at frequent intervals; many acres
of sod had been turned by the plow, and many more were
being shut in by fences where the open cattle range was
preempted by freeholds. One bit of woodland, however,
was beginning to dignify the valley. The Aydelot grove
spread over a hundred acres before the one-time sod Sunflower
Inn. The new home was on the swell now as Virginia
had seen the Colonial mansion of the mirage on the day
she went seeking aid for the grasshopper-beset neighborhood.
But this was just a little cottage waiting, like the
grove, for years of time in which to grow a mansion
shaded with tall trees, with the lake and the woodland
before it, and the open prairie beyond.</p>
<p>Down at Jim Shirley&#8217;s ranch the changes were many, for
Jim had an artist&#8217;s eye. And the energy other settlers
spent on the needs of wives and children Jim spent on
making his little dwelling attractive. He had brought
clover seed from Ohio, and had carefully sowed a fire guard
around his sod shack. Year by year the clover business
increased; fire guard grew to clover-lot, and clover-lot to
little meadow. Then the little meadow expanded along
Grass River to a small cattle range. Over the door of his
four-roomed cottage he put the name &#8220;Cloverdale,&#8221; as
he had put it over his sod cabin years before. And the
Cloverdale Ranch, like the Sunflower Ranch farther up the
river, became a landmark on the trail.</p>
<p>Pryor Gaines, still the teacher-preacher of the Grass
River settlement, had come to the Cloverdale Ranch on an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
errand, and he and Jim Shirley were chatting beside the well
curb when Dr. Carey drove up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Carey. How did you scent chicken pie so far?
And a plum pudding all brown and ready?&#8221; Shirley called
hospitably.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my business to find what produces sickness as well
as to provide cures,&#8221; Carey responded as he stepped from
his buggy to tie his horses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take him in the house, Pryor, while I stable his
crowbaits,&#8221; Jim said, patting one of the doctor&#8217;s well
groomed horses the while.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you will stay, too,&#8221; Horace Carey said to
Pryor Gaines. &#8220;I have some important news for Shirley,
and you and he are fast friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The bachelor twins of Grass River,&#8221; Pryor Gaines
declared. &#8220;Jim hasn&#8217;t any lungs and I haven&#8217;t any heart,
so we manage to keep a half a household apiece, and added
together make one fairly reputable citizen. I&#8217;ll stay if Jim
wishes me to, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The two most useful men in the community,&#8221; Carey
declared. &#8220;Jim has been father and mother, big brother,
and hired girl for half the settlement, while you, you
marry and train up and bury. No neighborhood is complete
without a couple of well-meaning old bachelors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about a bachelor M. D.?&#8221; Pryor Gaines asked.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve not been able to get in my work on you yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Purely a necessary evil, the M. D. business,&#8221; Carey
insisted. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Jim now. We wait the chicken and
plum pudding, Host Shirley.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim&#8217;s skill as a cook had not decreased since the day
when he prepared Asher Aydelot&#8217;s wedding supper, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
the three men who sat together at that day&#8217;s meal took
large enjoyment in this quiet hour together.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have a letter for you, Shirley,&#8221; the doctor said at
last. &#8220;It was sent to me some months ago with the
request that I give it to you when I had word to do so.
I have had word. Here it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll be going now.&#8221; Pryor Gaines rose with
the words.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go,&#8221; Jim insisted. &#8220;I want you here.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Gaines sat down. Shirley, who was quick in intuitive
power, knew instinctively what awaited him. He opened
the letter and read it while the two friends busied themselves
with a consideration of Jim&#8217;s bookcase, reading-table,
and toolchest combined, all made out of one goods box with
sundry trimmings.</p>
<p>Jim said nothing when he had finished, grateful that no
painful silence on the part of the other two men forced
him to words until he was ready to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to me,&#8221; he said at length. &#8220;I need your help
now. When I came West life didn&#8217;t seem worth living at
first, but I had it on my hands and couldn&#8217;t throw it away.
I tried to take an interest in Asher Aydelot&#8217;s home. But it
is a second-rate kind of pleasure to sit by your own lonely
fireside and enjoy the thought of the comfort another man
has in his home with the wife of his choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>A shadow fell on Dr. Carey&#8217;s face as he sat looking
through the open window at the stretch of green clover
down the valley.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was about ready to call time on myself one winter
here when Carey brought me a letter. It was from Alice
Leigh, my brother Tank&#8217;s wife. Tank and I were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
related&mdash;by marriage. We had the same father, but not the
same mother. My mother died the day I was born.
Nobody else is so helpless as a man with a one-day-old
baby. My father was fairly forced into a second marriage
by my step-mother, Betsy Tank. She was the housekeeper
at the tavern after my mother&#8217;s death. Her god was property
and Tank is just like her. She married the old Shirley
House. It looked big to her. Oh, well! I needn&#8217;t repeat a
common family history. I never had a mother, nor a wife,
nor a sister, nor a brother. Even my father was early prejudiced
in Tank&#8217;s interest against mine, always. The one
happy memory of my boyhood years was the loving interest
of Asher Aydelot&#8217;s mother, who made the old Aydelot farmhouse
on the National road a welcome spot to me. For
the Lord made me with a foolish longing for a home and
all of these things&mdash;father, mother, sister, and brother.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So you have been father and mother, brother and sister
to this whole settlement,&#8221; Pryor Gaines said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which may be vastly satisfying to these relatives, but
does not always fill the lack in one&#8217;s own life,&#8221; Horace
Carey added, as a man who might know whereof he spoke.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t bore you with details,&#8221; Jim began again.
&#8220;The letter I had from Alice Leigh, Tank&#8217;s wife, a dozen
or more years ago, asked me if I would take the guardianship
of her children if they should need a guardian. I
knew they would need one, if she were&mdash;taken from earth,
as she had reason to fear then that she might be soon. I
began to live with a new motive&mdash;a sense that I was
needed, a purpose to be ready to help her children&mdash;the
one service I could give to her. There&#8217;s a long, cruel story
back of her marriage to Tank&mdash;a story of deception,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
coercion, love of money, and all the elements of common
cussedness&mdash;too common to make a good story. And, as
generally happens, when Tank married the girl who didn&#8217;t
want him he treated her as he&#8217;s always treated everybody
else.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim clinched his fists hard and shut his teeth with a grip
as he sat silent for a moment. Then drawing a deep
breath, as if he were lifting a weight from his life, he
said calmly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Shirley died some time ago. Only one child
survived her&mdash;a little girl six years old. The letter
says&mdash;&#8221;The letter fluttered in Jim&#8217;s trembling hands.
&#8220;It says, &#8216;My little Leigh is just six. She has been
taught to love her uncle Jim.... Through the help of
a friend here&#8217;&mdash;she doesn&#8217;t give the name&mdash;&#8216;I have made
you her guardian. I want her to go to your home. Her
father will not take any responsibility, nor try to keep
her. I know you will not fail me.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim folded the letter abruptly. &#8220;It is a dead woman&#8217;s
last wish. How can I make a home for a little girl? What
shall I do?&#8221;</p>
<p>He looked at the two men for answer. The doctor lifted
his hand to Pryor Gaines, but the preacher waited awhile
before replying. Then he said thoughtfully:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is easy for us two to vote a duty on you, Shirley.
I answer only because you ask, not because I would advise.
From my angle of vision, this looks like your call to service.
Your lonely fireside is waiting for a little child&#8217;s
presence&mdash;the child already taught to love you. I would
say send for her at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can I send?&#8221; Jim questioned. &#8220;How can
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
I do a parent&#8217;s part by her? I can help a neighbor in need.
I can&#8217;t bring up his children. I&#8217;m not fit for that kind of
work. I&#8217;ve hung on here for more than a dozen years to
be ready to help when the time came, and now the thing
seems impossible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;As thy day, so shall thy strength be.&#8217; If you have
prepared yourself to do anything, you can do it,&#8221; Pryor
Gaines assured him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how can I send?&#8221; Jim asked again. &#8220;There&#8217;s
nobody there to bring her, and nobody here to go after
her. It&#8217;s an awfully long way from here to Ohio. A little
six-year-old girl can&#8217;t come alone. I couldn&#8217;t go back
myself. I may be a coward, but the Almighty made me as
I am. I can&#8217;t go back to Cloverdale and see only a grave&mdash;I
can stay here and remember, and maybe do a kind of
a man&#8217;s part, but I can&#8217;t go back.&#8221; He bowed his head
and sat very still.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Shirley,&#8221; Pryor Gaines spoke softly
still. &#8220;Unless you were close to the life in its last days,
don&#8217;t hang any graves like dead weights of ineffectual sorrow
about your neck. Look back to the best memories.
Look up to the eternal joy no grave can withhold.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a sympathetic chord in Pryor Gaines&#8217; voice
that spoke home to the heart, and so long as he lived in
the Grass River valley, he gave the last service for everyone
who left it for the larger life beyond it.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will go for you, Shirley,&#8221; Horace Carey said. &#8220;You
forget who brought you this letter. That it was sent to
me for you, and that the time to give it to you was left
until I was notified. This friend of your brother&#8217;s wife
is a friend of mine. Let me go.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Horace Carey, since the night your Virginia regiment
fed us poor starving fellows in the old war times, you&#8217;ve
been true blue.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I wore the gray that night, and I&#8217;d probably
do it again. I can&#8217;t tell. It was worth wearing, if only for
men to find out how much bigger manhood and brotherhood
are than any issue of war to be satisfied only by shedding of
innocent blood,&#8221; Horace Carey replied, glad to lift the
burden of thought from Shirley&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Could a sectional war ever have begun out here on these
broad prairies, where men need each other so?&#8221; Pryor
Gaines asked, following the doctor&#8217;s lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Something remarkably like it did make a stir out here
once. Like it, only worse,&#8221; Horace Carey answered with a
smile. &#8220;But the little girl, what&#8217;s her name? Leigh?
We&#8217;ll have her here for you. Your service is only beginning,
but think of the comfort of such a service. I envy
you, Jim.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A little child shall lead them,&#8221; Pryor Gaines added
reverently.</p>
<p>Then they fell to talking of the coming of little Leigh
Shirley. The hours of the day slipped by. The breeze
came pouring over the prairie from the far southwest
where the purple notches stood sentinel. The warm afternoon
sunlight streamed in at the door. The while these
childless men planned together for the welfare of one
motherless, and worse than fatherless, little girl away in
the Clover Creek Valley in Ohio, waiting for a home and
guardianship and love under far Kansas skies.</p>

<p>The Ohio woods were gorgeous with the October coloring.
The oak in regal purple stood outlined against
the beech in cloth-of-gold, while green-flecked hickory
and elm, and iridescent silver and scarlet ash, and flaming
maple added to the kaleidoscope of splendor.</p>
<p>The old National pike road leading down to Cloverdale
was still flanked by little rail-fenced fields that were bordered
by deep woodlands. The old Aydelot farmhouse was
as neat and white, with gardens and flower beds as well
kept, as if only a day had passed since the master and
mistress thereof had gone out to their last earthly home
in the Cloverdale graveyard.</p>
<p>Fifteen years had seen the frontier pushed westward
with magic swiftness. The Grass River Valley, once a wide
reach of emptiness and solitude, where only one homestead
stood a lone bulwark against the forces of the wilderness,
now, after a decade and a half, beheld its prairie dotted
with freeholds, where the foundations of homes were laid.</p>
<p>Fifteen years marked little appreciable change in the
heritage given up by Asher Aydelot out of his love for a
girl and his dream of a larger opportunity in the new
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
West. For fifteen springtimes the old-fashioned sweet
pinks had blossomed on the two mounds where his last
service had been given to his native estate. Hardly a tree
had been cut in the Aydelot woods. The marshes in the
lower ground had not been drained. The only change in
the landscape was the high grade of the railroad that cut
a triangle from the northwest corner of the farm in its
haste to reach Cloverdale and be done with it. The census
of 1880, however, showed an increase in ten years of
seventy-five citizens in Clover County, and the community
felt satisfied with itself.</p>
<p>The afternoon train on the Cloverdale branch was late
getting into town, but the station parasites were rewarded
for their patience by the sight of a stranger following the
usual two or three passengers who alighted. Strangers
were not so common in Cloverdale that anyone&#8217;s face would
be forgotten under ten years of time.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s that same feller that come here ten year or
mebby twelve year ago. I&#8217;d know him in Guinea,&#8221; one of
the oldest station parasites declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s him, sure as shootin&#8217;,&#8221; his comrade-in-laziness
agreed. &#8220;A doctor, don&#8217;t you ricolleck? Name&#8217;s Corrie,
no, Craney, no, that&#8217;s not it neither&mdash;A-ah!&#8221; trying hard
to think a little.</p>
<p>&#8220;Carey. Don&#8217;t you remember?&#8221; the first speaker broke
in, &#8220;Doc Carey. They say he doctored Miss Jane in Philadelphia,
an&#8217; got in good with her, more&#8217;n a dozen years
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; drawled the second watcher of affairs, &#8220;if he
thinks he can get anything out&#8217;n o&#8217; her by hangin&#8217; round
Cloverdale, he&#8217;s barkin&#8217; up the wrong saplin&#8217;. Miss Jane,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
she&#8217;s close, an&#8217; too set in her ways now. She must be nigh
forty.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. But, I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s goin&#8217; there now. Let&#8217;s
see.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two moved to the end of the station, from which
strategic point both the main street, the National pike
road, of course, and the new street running &#8220;cat-i-cornered&#8221;
from the station to the creek bridge could be
commanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darned fool! is what he is! hikin&#8217; straight as a
plumbline fur the crick. If he was worth it, I&#8217;d foller
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the ornery pup will be back all right. Lazy fellers
waitin&#8217; to marry rich old maids ain&#8217;t worth follerin&#8217;. Darn
&#8217;em! Slick skeezicks, tryin&#8217; to git rich jes&#8217; doin&#8217; nothin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>So the two citizens agreed while they consigned a perfect
stranger to a mild purgatory. His brisk wholesomeness
offended them, and the narrowness of their own daily
lives bred prejudice as the marshes breed mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Dr. Carey walked away with springing step. He was
glad to be at his journey&#8217;s end; glad to be off the slow
little train, and glad to see again the October woods of the
Alleghany foothills. To the eastern-bred man, nothing in
the grandeur of the prairie landscape can quite meet the
craving for the autumn beauty of the eastern forests. The
slanting rays of the late afternoon sun fell athwart the
radiant foliage of the woods as Dr. Carey&#8217;s way led him
between the two lines of flaming glory. When he had
cleared the creek valley, his pace slackened. Something
of the old boyhood joy of living, something of the sorrowful-sweet
memory, the tender grace of a day that is dead,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
but will never be forgotten, came with the pensive autumn
mood of Nature to make the day sweet to the pensive
mind.</p>
<p>Jane Aydelot sat on the veranda of the Aydelot home,
looking eagerly toward Cloverdale, when she discovered Dr.
Carey coming leisurely up the road. She was nearly
forty years old, as the railroad station loafers had declared,
but there was nothing about her to indicate the &#8220;old maid,
set in her ways.&#8221; She might have passed for Asher&#8217;s sister,
for she had a certain erect bearing and strong resemblance
of feature. All single women were called old maids
at twenty-five in those days. Else this fair-faced woman,
with clear gray eyes and pink cheeks, and scarce a hint of
white in her abundant brown hair, would not have been
considered in the then ridiculed class. There was a mixture
of resoluteness and of timidity in the expression of her
face betokening a character at once determined of will but
shrinking in action. And withal, she was daintily neat and
well kept, like her neat and well-kept farm and home.</p>
<p>As Dr. Carey passed up the flower-bordered walk, she
arose to greet him. If there was a look of glad expectancy
in her eyes, the doctor did not notice it, for the whole
setting of the scene was peacefully lovely, and the fresh-cheeked,
white-handed woman was a joy to see. Some
quick remembrance of the brown-handed claimholders&#8217; wives
crossed his mind at that instant, and like a cruel stab to
his memory came unbidden the picture of Virginia Thaine
in her dainty girlishness in the old mansion house of the
years now dead. Was he to blame that the contrast between
Asher Aydelot&#8217;s wife, now of Kansas, and Jane Aydelot of
Ohio should throw the favor toward the latter, that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
should forget for the moment what the women of the frontier
must sacrifice in the winning of the wilderness?</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you again, Doctor,&#8221; Jane Aydelot
said in cordial greeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very great pleasure to me, I assure you, Miss
Aydelot,&#8221; Horace Carey replied, grasping her hand.</p>
<p>Inside the house everything was as well appointed as
the outside suggested. As the doctor was making himself
more presentable after his long journey, he realized that
the pretty, old-fashioned bedroom had evidently been a
boy&#8217;s room once, Asher Aydelot&#8217;s room. And with a
woman&#8217;s loving sentiment, neither Asher&#8217;s mother nor the
present owner had changed it at all. The petals of a pink
rose of the wallpaper by the old-styled dresser were written
over in a boyish hand and the doctor read the names of
&#8220;Jim and Alice,&#8221; and &#8220;Asher and Nell.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Old sweethearts of &#8217;the Kerry Dancing&#8217; days,&#8221; he
thought to himself.</p>
<p>From the open window he looked out upon the magnificence
of the autumn forests and saw the white pike road
leading down to Clover Creek and the church spires and
courthouse tower above the trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;The heir to all this comfort and beauty gave it up
because he didn&#8217;t want to be a tavern-keeper here, and
because he did want a girl&mdash;Virginia!&#8221; Horace Carey
said the name softly. &#8220;I know what her jessamine-draped
window looked out upon. I hardly realized when I was here
before what Asher&#8217;s early home had been. Yet those two
for love of each other are building their lives into the life
of their chosen State. It is the tiller of the soil who must
make the West. But how many times in the lonely days
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
in that little sod cabin must they have remembered their
childhood homes! How many times when the hot fall
winds swept across the dead brown prairie have their memories
turned to the beauty of the October days here in the
East! Oh, well, the heroes weren&#8217;t all killed at Lexington
and Bunker Hill, nor at Bull Run and Gettysburg. Some
of them got away, and with heroic wives went out to conquer
the plains from the harsh rule of Nature there.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the doctor went downstairs again, a little girl met
him, saying, &#8220;Miss Jane says you may sit in the parlor,
or out on the meranda, till supper is ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How pleasant! Won&#8217;t you come and sit with me?&#8221;
Doctor Carey replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must put the&mdash;the lap-robes on the tables to everybody&#8217;s
plate, and the knives and forks and poons. Nen I&#8217;ll
come,&#8221; she answered.</p>
<p>Carey sat on the veranda enjoying the minutes and waiting
for the little girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221; he asked when she appeared, and
climbed into Miss Jane&#8217;s vacant chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leigh Shirley. What&#8217;s yours?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Horace Carey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor could not keep from smiling as he looked at
her. She was so little and pretty, with yellow hair, big
blue eyes, china-doll cheeks, and with all the repose of manner
that only childhood and innocence can bestow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I like you, Horace,&#8221; Leigh said frankly, after
carefully looking Carey over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, we&#8217;ll be friends,&#8221; he declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for so mery long.&#8221; Leigh could not master the
V of the alphabet yet. &#8220;&#8217;Cause I&#8217;m going away pretty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
soon, Miss Jane say. You know my mamma&#8217;s dead.&#8221; The
little face was very grave now. &#8220;And my Uncle Jim out
in Kansas wants me. I&#8217;m going to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even in her innocence, Doctor Carey noted the very
definite tone and clear trend of the young mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Jane loves me and I love her,&#8221; Leigh explained
further. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you love Miss Jane, Horace?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly,&#8221; Carey said, with some hesitancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell her so. She will love you, too. She is mery
sweet,&#8221; Leigh assured him. &#8220;Where are you going to?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to Kansas soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wim me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should like to. Let&#8217;s go together.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh slid quickly from the chair and ran inside, where
Doctor Carey heard her clear childish voice saying, &#8220;He
is going to Kansas, too, Miss Jane. He says he loves
you. His name is Horace, and he&#8217;s mery nice. He&#8217;s
not mery pretty, though, but you love him, too, don&#8217;t you,
Miss Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>Evidently the child was close to Miss Jane, for the doctor
heard something like a kiss and low words that seemed
to send her away on some errand. Presently he caught
sight of a sunny head and two big blue eyes and a little
hand beckoning to him, as Leigh peeped around the corner
of the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Jane says I mustn&#8217;t talk too much and mustn&#8217;t
call you Horace, but just Doctor Carey. Won&#8217;t you come
with me to get flowers for supper?&#8221;</p>
<p>The two strolled together into the old flower garden
where verbenas and phlox and late asters and early chrysanthemums
and a few monthly roses under Miss Jane&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
careful covering had weathered the first frosts. Leigh knew
each plant and shrub, and gave out information freely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you rather stay with Miss Jane?&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Carey knew he should not ask the question, but
it came anyhow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I want to go to my Uncle Jim.&#8221; Leigh settled
the matter once for all.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>That night Leigh fell asleep early, for Miss Jane was
methodical with children. Then she and Doctor Carey sat
until late by the open wood fire and talked of many things,
but first of Leigh and her future.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will miss her, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; the doctor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;More than anyone will know,&#8221; Miss Jane replied.
&#8220;But I could not be happy without fulfilling my promise.
I wrote you to come soon because each day makes the
giving up a little harder for me. But I must know the
truth about this Uncle Jim. I cannot send Leigh out of
my house to be neglected and unloved. She demands love
above all things.&#8221;</p>
<p>The pink color deepened in Miss Jane&#8217;s fair cheek as she
recalled what Leigh had said to Doctor Carey about loving
her. The doctor remembered also, and knew why she
blushed. Yet blushes, he thought, were becoming to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you all I know of Mr. Shirley. We have been
friends for many years,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Then as truthfully as possible he told her of the life
and mind of the lonely loving plainsman. When he had
finished, Miss Jane sat awhile in silent thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is right that you should know something of conditions
here, Doctor,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;The older
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
Shirleys are dead. Tank&#8217;s life hastened the end for them, the
Cloverdale gossips say. And as I have owned the Shirley
House for several years, I came to know them well, and I
do not think the gossips were far out of the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What of Tank&#8217;s life?&#8221; Doctor Carey asked. &#8220;I have
some personal reasons for asking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Jane looked up quickly. She was a pretty woman,
and a keenly intelligent one as well. To Horace Carey,
she seemed most charming at that moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me tell you of Alice first,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You know,
of course, that she loved Jim. They were just suited to
each other. But her mother and Tank&#8217;s mother planned
otherwise. Alice was submissive. Tank was greedy. He
wanted the old Leigh farm. And envious, for he seemed to
hate Jim always. It grew to be the passion of his life to
want to take whatever Jim had. His mother hated Jim
before he was born. It was his pre-natal heritage, combined
with a selfish nature. There was misrepresentation and
deception enough to make a plot for a novel; a misunderstanding
and brief estrangement, separating Jim and Alice
forever&mdash;all managed by Tank and his mother, for the
farm first, and the downfall of Jim second. They took no
account of Alice, who must be the greatest loser. And after
they were married, both mothers-in-law were disappointed,
for the Leigh farm was heavily incumbered and sold by the
sheriff the same fall, and the Shirley House fell into Uncle
Francis Aydelot&#8217;s hands in about the same way. Love of
property can be the root of much misery.&#8221; Miss Jane
paused, for the story brought bitterness to her kindly soul.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is ended now,&#8221; Horace Carey said gently. &#8220;It is
well that it is, I am sure.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Alice rests now beside her two little ones who went
before her. She had no sorrow in going, except for Leigh.
And&#8221;&mdash;</p>
<p>&#8220;And you lifted that, I know.&#8221; Doctor Carey finished
the sentence.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to,&#8221; Miss Jane said, struggling between timidity
and truthfulness. &#8220;I made her last hours peaceful, for
she knew Leigh would be cared for and safe. I saw to that.
Tank Shirley is bound to a surrender of all legal claim to
her. It was left to Jim to take her, if he chose. If not,
she belongs to me. She is a strange child, wise beyond her
years, with a sort of power already for not telling all she
knows. You can rely on her in almost anything. She will
make a strong woman some day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Carey read the loving sacrifice back of the words,
and his heart warmed toward this sweet-spirited, childless
woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim wants her, else I could not have come,&#8221; he said
gently, &#8220;but you can come to Grass River to see her
sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, it is so far,&#8221; Jane Aydelot said, and Carey realized
in how small an orbit her life revolved.</p>
<p>&#8220;But she does good in it. What does distance count,
against that?&#8221; he thought to himself. Aloud he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me of Tank, Miss Aydelot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He has run his course here, but he is shrewd enough to
escape the law. His parents mortgaged the Shirley House
to get money to keep his doings quiet. My Uncle Francis
foreclosed on them at last. But by Jim&#8217;s abrupt leaving,
Cloverdale blamed him for a long time for the family misfortunes.
Tank broke every moral law; he invested his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
money wildly in his greed to make more money, until finally
the bank failure came. That is a long story, and it was a
dead loss. But the cashier&#8217;s suicide stopped investigation.
All blame was laid on him. And he, being dead, made no
complaint and incriminated nobody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is Tank now?&#8221; Carey asked.</p>
<p>He did not know why the image of Thomas Smith of
Wilmington, Delaware, should come unbidden to his mind
just now, nor why he should feel that the answer to his
question held only a portion of what could have been told
him then.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody knows exactly where,&#8221; Jane Aydelot replied.
&#8220;He left his wife penniless. She lived here with me and
died here. Tank hasn&#8217;t been seen in Cloverdale for a long
time. It is strange how family ties get warped sometimes.
And oftenest over property.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Carey thought of Asher, and was silent. But
Jane Aydelot divined his thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am thinking of our own family,&#8221; she said, looking
into the heart of the wood fire. &#8220;I have my cousin Asher&#8217;s
heritage, which by law now neither he nor any child of his
can receive from me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Aydelot, he doesn&#8217;t want it. And there is no
prejudice in him against you at all. Moreover, if his
dreams come true, little Thaine Aydelot will never need it.&#8221;
There was a sternness in Carey&#8217;s voice that pained his
hostess.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Doctor Carey!&#8221; she began hesitatingly. Then,
as if to change the trend of thought, she added simply,
&#8220;I try to use it well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Horace Carey was by nature and experience a keen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
reader of human minds. As Jane Aydelot studied the burning
coals in the grate, he studied her face, and what he read
there gave him both pleasure and pain. Between him and
that face came the image of Virginia Aydelot, who should
be there instead; of the brown-handed farmer&#8217;s wife, who
had given up so much for the West. And yet, that face,
framed in its dark hair, lighted by luminous dark eyes,
seemed to blot out the dainty pink and white Jane Aydelot.
A strength of will, a view of life at wide angles of vision,
a resourcefulness and power of sacrifice seemed to deify the
plainly clad prairie home-maker, winning, not inheriting,
her possessions. Had Jane been anywhere else save in the
home that Virginia might have had, her future might have
had another story. But why forecast the might-have-been?</p>
<p>&#8220;You do use your property well, I am sure,&#8221; Doctor
Carey said, replying to the last words spoken between them,
&#8220;and yet, you would give it up?&#8221; He knew her answer,
or he would not have asked the question.</p>
<p>For reply, she rose and went to the little writing desk
where the Aydelot papers were kept. Taking therefrom
two documents, she placed them in Carey&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Read these,&#8221; she said, &#8220;then promise me that in the
hour when Leigh needs my help you will let me help
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were the will of Francis Aydelot and her own will.
How much of sacrifice lay in that act of hers, only Horace
Carey could understand.</p>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></div>
<p>&#8220;I promise gladly, Miss Aydelot. I see why you are
willing to give up little Leigh now,&#8221; he said, looking up
with eyes filled with sincerest admiration. &#8220;You are a
wonderful woman. You have the same Aydelot heritage of
endurance and patience and the large view of duty that
characterizes your cousin Asher. Your setting is different.
I hope the time may come soon when Ohio and Kansas will
not be so far apart as they are tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose and took her hand in his.</p>
<p>If Doctor Carey&#8217;s magnetism made men admire him, it
was no less an attractive force with women. As he looked
into Jane Aydelot&#8217;s gray eyes, he saw a new light there.
And swiftly its meaning translated itself to him. He
dropped her hand and turned away, and when their eyes
met again, the light was gone.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>It was still Indian-Summer weather on the prairie when
Doctor Carey with little Leigh Shirley reached Careyville.
He had a feeling that Jim would prefer meeting Leigh in
his own home, so no word had been sent forward as to
the time of the coming of the two.</p>
<p>All through the journey, the doctor had wondered how
Jane Aydelot could have given Leigh up at all. She was
such a happy prattler, such an honest, straightforward
little body, such an innocent child, and, withal, so loving
that Carey lost his own heart before the first half day was
ended. In her little gray wool gown and her gray cap with
its scarlet quill above her golden hair, she was as dainty
and pretty as a picture of childhood could be.</p>
<p>Down on the Grass River trail, the two came upon Thaine
Aydelot trudging in from some errand to a distant neighbor,
and the doctor hailed him at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come, ride with us. We&#8217;ll take you home,&#8221; he said,
turning the wheel for Thaine&#8217;s convenience. &#8220;This is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
Leigh Shirley, who is coming to live with her uncle, Jim.
You&#8217;ll like to go to the Cloverdale Ranch more than ever
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine was only a little country boy, unused to conventionalities,
so he took Leigh on her face value at once.
And Leigh, honest as she was innocent, returned the compliment.
At the Sunflower Ranch, Carey drew rein to let
Thaine leave them. Leigh, putting both arms about the
little boy&#8217;s neck, kissed him good-by, saying: &#8220;I have
known you always because you are the Thaine&#8221;&mdash;she
caught her breath, and added: &#8220;You must come to my
uncle Jim&#8217;s and see me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will, I will,&#8221; Thaine assured her.</p>
<p>Doctor Carey looked back to wave good-by just in time
to see Virginia Aydelot coming toward Thaine, who stood
watching the buggy. Instantly the pretty face of Jane
Aydelot came to his mind, her face as she had looked on the
night when they sat by the wood fire in the Aydelot farmhouse.
Against that picture stood the reality of Virginia
with her richer coloring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor storm nor stress can rob her of her beauty,&#8221; he
thought. &#8220;However sweet and self-sacrificing Jane Aydelot
may be, the Plains would have broken her long ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned about at once and came back to where Thaine
stood beside his mother.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is Jim Shirley&#8217;s little girl, Mrs. Aydelot,&#8221; he said,
gently patting Leigh&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my wife,&#8221; little Thaine said gravely. &#8220;We
will go and live at the purple notches when I come home
from the war.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s heart warmed toward the motherless little one,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
and Leigh understood her at once. Nor once in all the
years that followed did the two fail each other.</p>
<p>The Cloverdale homestead never had known such a gala
fixing as Jim Shirley had kept there for nearly a week
awaiting the doctor&#8217;s return. Truly, love is genius in
itself, and only genius could have put so many quaint and
attractive touches to such common surroundings as now
embellished the little four-roomed house in the bend of
Grass River.</p>
<p>Doctor Carey tied his horses to the post beside the trail,
and, lifting Leigh from the buggy, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Jim is up there waiting for you, and oh, so
glad, so glad to have you come. Go and meet him, Leigh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh smoothed her little gray wool frock down with
her dainty little hands. Then, pushing back the gray cap
with its scarlet quill from her forehead where the golden
hair fell in soft rings, she passed up the grassy way to
meet Jim Shirley. He could never have looked bigger
and handsomer than he did at that moment. In his eyes
all the heart hunger of years seemed centered as he watched
the little six-year-old child coming towards him.</p>
<p>Just before reaching the doorway, she paused, and with
that clear penetration only a little child possesses, she looked
up into the strong man&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Jim. My Uncle Jim,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I can love
you always.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jim gathered her close in his arms, and she clung about
his neck, softly patting his brown cheek as they passed into
the house. While all unseen, the light of love went in
with them, a light that should never fade from the hearthstone,
driving loneliness and sorrow from it, far away.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></p>
<p>Leigh Shirley&#8217;s coming marked an epoch in the annals
of the Grass River settlement, for her uncle often declared
that he could remember only two events in the West before
that time: the coming of Mrs. Aydelot and the grasshopper
raid. With Leigh in his home, he almost forgot that he
had ever been sad-hearted. This loving little child was
such a constant source of interest and surprise. She was
so innocently plain-spoken and self-dependent sometimes,
and such a strange little dreamer of dreams at other times.
She would drive a shrewd bargain for whatever she wanted&mdash;some
more of Uncle Jim&#8217;s good cookies, or a ride all alone
on the biggest pony, or a two-days&#8217; visit at the Aydelot
ranch, scrupulously rendering back value received of her
own wares&mdash;kisses, or washing all the supper dishes for her
tired uncle, or staying away from her play to watch that
the chickens did not scratch in the garden.</p>
<p>But there were times when she would go alone to the
bend in the river and people her world with folk of her own
creation and live with them and for them. Chief among
them all was a certain Prince Quippi, who would come from
China some day to marry her and take her away to a house
made of purple velvet and adorned with gold knobs. She
had to send a letter to Prince Quippi every day or he
would think she did not love him. Of course, she loved
Uncle Jim best of what she called folks&mdash;but Prince
Quippi was big and brown and handsome; and, strangely
enough, the only kind of letter he could read from her was
in a flower.</p>
<p>So Leigh dropped a flower on the waters of Grass River
every day to float away to China telling her love to Prince
Quippi. And oftenest it was the tawny sunflower, because it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
was big and strong and could tell a big love story. Thus
she dreamed her happy dreams until one day Thaine
Aydelot, listening to her, said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why my papa sent my mamma a sunflower once, and
made her love him very much. I&#8217;ll be your real Prince
Quippi&mdash;not a&mdash;a paper-doll, thinkish one, and come
after you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Clear from China?&#8221; Leigh queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, when I&#8217;m a big soldier like my papa, and we&#8217;ll go
off to the purple notches and live.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look like my Prince Quippi,&#8221; Leigh insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I can grow to look like <i>any</i> thing I want to&mdash;like
a big elephant or a hippopopamus or a&mdash;angel, or <i>any</i>
<i>thing</i>,&#8221; Thaine assured her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, escuse me from any of the free&mdash;a angel or a
elephant. I don&#8217;t know what the poppy one is, but it&#8217;s
too poppy,&#8221; Leigh said decisively.</p>
<p>There were others in the Grass River settlement who
would have envied the mythical Prince Quippi also. For
even at six years of age Leigh had the same quality that
marked her uncle. People must love her if they cared for
her at all; and they couldn&#8217;t help caring for her. She fitted
into the life of the prairie, too, as naturally as Thaine
Aydelot did, who was born to it. The baby gold was soon
lost from her hair for the brown-gold like the shimmering
sunlight on the brown prairie. The baby blue eyes deepened
to the deep violet-blue of overhead skies in June. The
pretty pink and white complexion, however, did not
grow brown under the kisses of the prairie winds. The
delicate china-doll tinting went with other baby features,
but, save for the few little brown freckles in midsummer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
Leigh Shirley kept year after year the clear complexion
with the peach blossom pink on her cheeks that only rarely
the young girls of the dry western plains possessed in those
days of shadeless homes.</p>
<p>Thaine Aydelot looked like a gypsy beside her, he was
so brown, and his big dark eyes and heavy mane of dark
hair, and ruddy cheeks made the contrast striking. From
the first day of their meeting, the children were playmates
and companions as often as opportunity offered. They
sat together in the Grass River Sabbath School; they exchanged
days on days of visits, and the first sorrow of their
hitherto unclouded lives came when they found that Leigh
was too far away to attend the week-day school.</p>
<p>Settlers were filling up the valley rapidly, but they all
wanted ranches, and ranches do not make close neighbors.
Land-lust sometimes overshadows the divine rights of children.
And the lower part of the settlement was not yet
equal to the support of a school of its own.</p>
<p>The two families still kept the custom of spending their
Sabbaths together. And one Sabbath Thaine showed Leigh
the books and slate and sponge and pencils he was to take
to school the next week. Leigh, who had been pleased
with all of them, turned to her guardian, saying gravely:</p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Jim, can I go to school wif Thaine?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must meet that question every day now, Jim,&#8221;
Asher said. &#8220;Why not answer it and be rid of it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I answer it?&#8221; Jim queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virgie, help us with this educational problem of the
State,&#8221; Asher turned to his wife. &#8220;Women are especially
resourceful in these things, Jim. I hope Kansas will fully
recognize the fact some day.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Kansas?&#8221; Virginia asked with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, all of us men who depend so much on some woman&#8217;s
brain every day of our lives,&#8221; Jim assured her. &#8220;Tell me,
what to do for my little girl. Mrs. Bennington and some of
the other neighbors say I should send her East for her
sake&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And for both of your sakes, Jim, I say, no,&#8221; Virginia
broke in. &#8220;The way must open for all of our children
here. It always has for everything else, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine can walk the two miles. He&#8217;s made of iron,
anyhow. But Leigh can&#8217;t make the five miles &#8216;up stream,&#8217;&#8221;
Asher declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim,&#8221; Virginia Aydelot said gravely, &#8220;Pryor Gaines
will be our teacher for many years, we hope, but he is
hardly equal to tilling his ground now. John Jacobs holds
the mortgage on his claim still that he put there after the
grasshopper loan, which he could not pay. Life is an
uphill pull for him, and he bears his burdens so cheerfully.
I believe Mr. Jacobs would take the claim and pay him the
equity. We all know how unlike a Shylock John Jacobs
really is, even if he is getting rich fast. Now, Jim, why
not take Pryor into your home and let him drive up to
the school with Leigh and the other little folks down your
way. We can pay him better wages and he will have a real
home, not a lonely cabin by himself, and you will be fortunate
in having such a man in your household.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the thing, Virginia,&#8221; Jim declared. &#8220;Why haven&#8217;t
we done it before? He always says I&#8217;m his heart and he&#8217;s
my lungs. We might stack up to a one-man power. Old
bachelors should be segregated, anyhow, out here. The
West needs more families. And think what Pryor Gaines&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
cultivated mind will mean to a little artist soul like Leigh
Shirley&#8217;s. Glorious!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Virgie, if you will also segregate John Jacobs
and Dr. Carey, we&#8217;ll settle the bachelors once for all. A
quartette of royal good fellows, too, State-makers who
really make. They ought to be in the legislature, but
Carey and Pryor are democrats and Jim and Jacobs are
republican. They balance too well for the interests of any
party. Anyhow, if Pryor agrees, the school problem is
fixed,&#8221; Asher asserted.</p>
<p>Pryor Gaines did agree, to the welfare of many children,
who remember him still with that deep-seated affection of
student for teacher unlike any other form of human devotion.
But especially did this cultured man put into Leigh
Shirley&#8217;s life a refining artistic power that stood her well in
the years to come.</p>

<p>With successive seasons of good crops, combining
with the time of the crest between two eras of financial
depression, and with Eastern capital easy to reach, a
mania of speculation known as &#8220;the boom&#8221; burst forth;
a mania that swept men&#8217;s minds as prairie fires sweep along
the wide lengths of the plains, changing both the face of
the land and the fortunes of the land owners, and marking
an epoch in the story of the West. New counties were
organized out of the still unoccupied frontier. Thousands
of citizens poured into these counties. Scores of towns
were chartered and hundreds of miles of railroad were constructed.
Colleges and universities sprouted up from the
virgin soil of the prairie. Loans on real estate were easy
to secure. Land, especially in town lots, took on an enormously
inflated valuation and the rapid investment in real
estate and the rapid transference from buyer to seller was
bewildering, while voting bonds for extensive and extravagant
improvements in cities-to-be was not the least phase
of this brief mania of the fortune-making, fortune-breaking
&#8220;boom.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Hans Wyker had seen his own town wane as
Careyville waxed, he consigned the newer community, and
all that it was, to all the purgatories ever organized and
some yet to be created.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>Wykerton was at a standstill now. The big brewery
had become a flouring mill, but it was idle most of the
time. The windows served as targets for the sons of the
men who consumed its brewing product in other days,
and the whole structure had a disconsolate, dismantled
appearance.</p>
<p>There was neither a schoolhouse nor a church inside the
corporation limits. The land along Big Wolf was not like
the rich prairies west of it, and freeholds entered first
with hopes in Wykerton&#8217;s prosperity had proved disappointing,
if not disastrous, to their owners.</p>
<p>The rough ground, mortgaged now, and by the decline
of the town, decreased in value, began to fall into the hands
of John Jacobs, who made no effort at settlement, but
turned it to grazing purposes. His holdings joined the
property foreclosed by Wyker when his town failed, but
inhabited still by tenants too poor to leave it. The boundary
line between Wyker and Jacobs was the same ugly
little creek that Doctor Carey had turned his course to
avoid on that winter day when he had seen Virginia Aydelot&#8217;s
distress signal and heard her singing a plaintive plea
for help.</p>
<p>It was an ugly little stream, with much mire and some
quicksand to be avoided; with deep earth-canyons and
sliding avalanches of dirt on steep slopes, and now and then
a stone outcrop jagged and difficult, not to say dangerous,
to footways, and impossible to stock. It was called Little
Wolf because it was narrower than the willow-fringed
stream into which it emptied. But Big Wolf Creek could
rarely boast of half the volume of water that the sluggish
little tributary held. Big Wolf was shallow, with more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
shale and sand along its bed. Little Wolf was narrow and
deceivingly deep in places.</p>
<p>One Spring day, John Jacobs and Asher Aydelot rode
out to Jacobs&#8217; ranches together.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are improving your stock every year, Stewart tells
me,&#8221; Asher was saying. &#8220;I may try sheep myself next
year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am hoping to have only thoroughbreds some day.
That&#8217;s a good horse you ride,&#8221; Jacobs replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he has a strain of Kentucky blue-blood. My
wife owned a thoroughbred when we came West. We keep
the descent still. We&#8217;ve never been without a black horse
in the stable since that time. Do we turn here?&#8221;</p>
<p>They were following the lower trail by the willows,
when Jacobs turned abruptly to a rough roadway leading
up a shadowy hollow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It&#8217;s an ugly climb, but much shorter to the sheep
range and the cattle are near.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How much land have you here, Jacobs?&#8221; Asher
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;From Little Wolf to the corporation line of Wykerton.
Five hundred acres, more or less; all fenced, too,&#8221;
Jacobs added. &#8220;This creek divides Wyker&#8217;s ground from
mine. All the rest is measured by links and chains. We
agreed to metes and bounds for this because it averages the
same, anyhow, and I&#8217;d like a stream between Wyker and
myself in addition to a barbed wire fence. It gives more
space, at least.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had followed the rough way only a short distance
when Asher, who was nearest the creek, halted. The bank
was steep and several feet above the water.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Does anybody else keep sheep around here?&#8221; he
inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not here,&#8221; John Jacobs answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look over there. Isn&#8217;t that a sheep?&#8221;</p>
<p>Asher pointed to a carcass lying half out of the water
on a pile of drift where the stream was narrow, but too
deep for fording.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe some dog killed it and the carcass got into the
creek. My sheep can&#8217;t get to the water because my pasture
is fenced. That&#8217;s on Wyker&#8217;s side, anyhow. I won&#8217;t
risk fording to get over there. It&#8217;s as dead right now as
it will ever be,&#8221; Jacobs asserted.</p>
<p>Their trail grew narrower and more secluded, winding up
a steep hill between high banks. Half way up, where the
road made a sharp turn, a break in the side next to the
creek opened a rough way down to the water. As they
neared this, a woman coming down the hill caught sight
of the two horsemen around the bend, and made a swift
movement toward this opening in the bank, as if to
clamber down from their sight. She was not quick
enough, however, and when she found she had been
seen, she waited by the roadside until the men had
passed on.</p>
<p>Asher, who was next to her, looked keenly at her as he
bade her good morning, but John Jacobs merely lifted his
hat without giving her more than a glance.</p>
<p>The woman stared at both, but made no response to
their greetings. She was plainly dressed, with a black
scarf tied over her tow-colored hair. She had a short club
in one hand and a big battered tin can in the other, which
she seemed anxious to conceal. When the men had passed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
she looked after them with an ugly expression of malice
in her little pale gray eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a bad face,&#8221; Asher said, when they were out
of her hearing. &#8220;I wonder why she tried to hide that
old salt can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know it was a salt can?&#8221; Jacobs asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it is exactly like a salt can I saw at Pryor
Gaines&#8217; old cabin, and because some salt fell out as she
tipped it over,&#8221; Asher replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have an eye for details,&#8221; Jacobs returned. &#8220;That
was Gretchen Gimpke, Hans Wyker&#8217;s girl. She married
his bartender, and is raising a family of little bartenders
back in the hilly country there, while Gimpke helps Hans
run a perfectly respectable tavern in town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I may misjudge her, but if I had any interest
near here, I should want her to keep on her own side of the
creek,&#8221; Asher declared.</p>
<p>And somehow both remembered the dead sheep down in
the deep pool at the foot of the hill.</p>
<p>The live sheep were crowding along the fence on the
creek side of the big range when the two men entered it.</p>
<p>&#8220;What ails the flock?&#8221; Asher asked, as they saw it
following the fence line eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s ride across and meet them,&#8221; Jacobs suggested.</p>
<p>The creek side was rough with many little dips and draws
hiding the boundary line in places. The men rode quietly
toward the flock by the shortest way. As they faced a hollow
deepening to a draw toward the creek, Asher suddenly
halted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at that!&#8221; he cried, pointing toward the fence.</p>
<p>John Jacobs looked and saw where the ground was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
lowest that the barbed wires had been dragged out of place,
leaving an opening big enough for two or more sheep to
crowd through at a time. As they neared this point,
Asher said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty clear case, Jacobs. See that line of salt
running up the bare ground, and here is an opening. The
flock is coming down on that line. They will have a
chance to drink after taking their salt.&#8221;</p>
<p>John Jacobs slid from his horse, and giving the rein to
Asher, he climbed through the hole in the fence and hastily
examined the ground beyond it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a friendly act on somebody&#8217;s part,&#8221; he said grimly.
&#8220;The creek cuts a deep hole under the bank here. There&#8217;s
a pile of salt right at the edge. Somebody has sprinkled
a line of it clear over the hill to toll the flock out where
they will scramble for it and tumble over into that deep
water. All they need to do is to swim down to the next
shallow place and wade out. The pool may be full of
them now, waiting their turn to go. Sheep are polite in
deep water; they never rush ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They swim well, too, especially if they happen to fall
into the water just before shearing time when their wool
is long,&#8221; Asher said ironically.</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you say Gretchen Gimpke had in that tin
can?&#8221; Jacobs inquired blandly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oil of sassafras, I think,&#8221; Asher responded, as he tied
the horses and helped to mend the weakened fence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody prospers long after such tricks. I&#8217;ll not lose
sleep over lost sheep,&#8221; John Jacobs declared. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hunt
up the cattle and forget this, and the woman and the
scary little twist in the creek trail.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;It&#8217;s a friendly act on somebody&#8217;s part.&#8221; he said grimly<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Why scary?&#8221; Asher asked. &#8220;Are you so afraid of
women? No wonder you are a bachelor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacobs did not smile as he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Once when I was a child I read a story of a man being
killed at just such an out-of-the-way place. Every time I
go up that crooked, lonesome hill road, I remember the picture
in the book. It always makes me think of that story.&#8221;</p>
<p>When the fence was made secure, the two rode away to
look after the cattle. And if a Shadow rode beside them, it
was mercifully unseen, and in nowise dimming to the clear
light of the spring day.</p>
<p>It was high noon when they reached Wykerton, where
Hans Wyker still fed the traveling public, although the
flourishing hotel where Virginia Aydelot first met John
Jacobs had disappeared. The eating-place behind the general
store room was divided into two parts, a blind partition
wall cutting off a narrow section across the farther end.
Ordinary diners went through the store into the dining
room and were supplied from the long kitchen running
parallel with this room.</p>
<p>There were some guests, however, who entered the farther
room by a rear door and were likewise supplied from the
kitchen on the side. But as there was no opening between
the two rooms, many who ate at Wyker&#8217;s never knew of the
narrow room beyond their own eating-place and of the
two entrances into the kitchen covering the side of each
room. Of course, the prime reason for such an arrangement
lay in Wyker&#8217;s willingness to evade the law and
supply customers with contraband drinks. But the infraction
of one law is a breach in the wall through which many
lawless elements may crowd. The place became, by natural
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
selection, the council chamber of the lawless, and many an
evil deed was plotted therein.</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you like to keep a store in a place like this,
Jacobs?&#8221; Asher Aydelot asked, as the two men waited for
their meal.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had the chance once. I turned it down. How would
you like to keep a tavern in such a place?&#8221; Jacobs returned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I turned down a bigger tavern than this once to be a
farmer. I have never regretted it,&#8221; Asher replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Sunflower Ranch has always interested me. How
long have you had it?&#8221; Jacobs asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since 1869. I was the first man on Grass River. Shirley
came soon afterward,&#8221; Asher said.</p>
<p>&#8220;And your ranches are typical of you, too,&#8221; John
Jacobs said thoughtfully. &#8220;How much do you own now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Six quarters,&#8221; Asher replied. &#8220;I&#8217;ve added piece by
piece. Mortgaged one quarter to buy another. There&#8217;s
a good deal of it under mortgage now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to know what&#8217;s ahead pretty well,&#8221; Jacobs
remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what&#8217;s in the prairie soil pretty well. I know
that crops will fail sometimes and boom sometimes, and I
know if I live I mean to own three times what I have now;
that I&#8217;ll have a grove a mile square on it, and a lake in
the middle, and a farmhouse of colonial style up on the
swell where we are living now and that neither John Jacobs
nor the First National Bank of Careyville will hold any
mortgage on it.&#8221; Asher&#8217;s face was bright with anticipation.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a dreamer, Aydelot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Jim Shirley&#8217;s a dreamer,&#8221; Asher insisted. &#8220;Mrs.
Aydelot and I planned our home the first night she came a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
bride to our little one-roomed soddy. There are cottonwoods
and elms and locust trees shading our house now
where there was only a bunch of sunflowers then, and except
for Jim&#8217;s little corn patch and mine, not a furrow turned
in the Grass River Valley. We have accomplished something
since then. Why not the whole thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have reason for your faith, I admit. But you are
right, Shirley is a dreamer. What&#8217;s the matter with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An artistic temperament, more heart than head, a
neglected home life in his boyhood, and a fight for health
to do his work. He&#8217;ll die mortgaged, but he has helped
so many other fellows to lift theirs, I envy Jim&#8217;s &#8216;abundant
entrance&#8217; by and by. But now he dreams of a thousand
things and realizes none. Poor fellow! His dooryard is
a picture, while the weeds sometimes choke his garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he&#8217;ll die mortgaged. He&#8217;s never paid me interest
nor principal on my little loan, yet I&#8217;d increase it tomorrow
if he asked me to do it,&#8221; John Jacobs declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a blood-sucking Shylock, sure enough,&#8221; Asher
said with a smile. &#8220;I wish Jim would take advantage of
you and quit his talking about the boom and his dreams
of what it might do for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How soon will you be platting your Sunflower Ranch
into town lots for the new town that I hear is to be started
down your way?&#8221; John Jacobs inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Town lots do not appeal to me, Jacobs,&#8221; Asher replied.
&#8220;I&#8217;m a slow-growing Buckeye, I&#8217;ll admit, but I can&#8217;t see
anything but mushrooms in these towns out West where
there is no farming community about them. I&#8217;ve waited
and worked a good while; I&#8217;m willing to work and wait a
while longer. Some of my dreams have come true. I&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
hold to my first position, even if I don&#8217;t get rich so fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are level-headed,&#8221; Jacobs assured him. &#8220;You
notice I have not turned an acre in on this boom. Why?
I&#8217;m a citizen of Kansas. And while I like to increase my
property, you know my sect bears that reputation&mdash;&#8221;Jacobs
never blushed for his Jewish origin&mdash;&#8220;I want to
keep on living somewhere. Why not here? Why do the
other fellows out of their goods, as we Jews are always
accused of doing, if it leaves me no customer to buy? I
want farmers around my town, not speculators who work
a field from hand to hand, but leave it vacant at last. It
makes your merchant rich today but bankrupt in a dead
town tomorrow. I&#8217;m a merchant by calling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Horace Greeley said thirty years ago that the twin
curses of Kansas were the land agent and the one-horse
politician,&#8221; Asher observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a grub, Aydelot. You have no ambition at all.
Why, I&#8217;ve heard your name mentioned favorably several
times for the legislature next winter,&#8221; Jacobs insisted
jokingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which reminds me of that rhyme of Hosea Bigelow:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>If you&#8217;re arter folks o&#8217; gumption</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>You&#8217;ve a darned long row to hoe.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not an office seeker,&#8221; Asher replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do I understand you won&#8217;t sell lots off that ranch of
yours to start a new town, and you won&#8217;t run for the legislature
when you&#8217;re dead sure to be elected. May I ask
how you propose to put in the fall after wheat harvest?&#8221;
Jacobs asked, with a twinkle in his black eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I propose to break ground for wheat again, and to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
experiment with alfalfa, the new hay product, and to take
care of that Aydelot grove and build the Aydelot lake in
the middle of it. And I&#8217;ll be supplying the wheat market
and banking checks for hay one of these years when your
town starters will be hunting clerkships in your dry goods
emporium, and your farmers, who imagine themselves each
a Cincinnatus called to office, will be asking for appointment
as deputy county assessor or courthouse custodian.
Few things can so unfit a Kansas fellow for the real business
of life as a term in the lower house of the Kansas legislature.
If you are a merchant, I&#8217;m a farmer, and we will
both be booming the state when these present-day boomers
are gone back East to wife&#8217;s folks, blaming Kansas for their
hard luck. Now, mark my words. But to change the subject,&#8221;
Asher said smiling, &#8220;I thought we should have company
for dinner. I saw Darley Champers and another
fellow head in here before us. Darley is in clover now,
planning to charter a town for every other section on Grass
River. Did you know the man who was with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one fly-by-night calling himself Thomas Smith.
Innocent name and easy to lose if you don&#8217;t want it. Not
like Gimpke or Aydelot, now. He&#8217;s from Wilmington,
Delaware&mdash;maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to doubt his genuineness,&#8221; Asher remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe he will assay well,&#8221; Jacobs agreed.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve doubted him since the day he landed in Carey&#8217;s Crossing
fifteen years ago. Inside of an hour and a half I
caught him and Champers in a consultation so secret they
fastened newspapers across the window to keep from being
seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where were you meanwhile?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Up on the roof, fixing the sign the wind had blown
loose. When they saw me through the uncovered upper pane,
they shaded that, too. I&#8217;ve little interest in a man like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he come here often?&#8221; Asher inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s here and away, but he never sets foot in Careyville.
My guess is that he&#8217;s a part of the &#8217;Co.&#8217; of &#8216;Champers
and Co.&#8217; and that Hans Wyker is the rest of it. Also
that in what they can get by fair means, each of the trio
reserves the right to act alone and independently of the
other two, but when it comes to a cut-throat game, they
combine as readily as hydrogen and sulphur and oxygen;
and, combined, they have the same effect on a proposition
that sulphuric acid has on litmus paper. But this is
all only a Jew&#8217;s guess, of course. For myself, I have business
with only one of the three, Wyker. He doesn&#8217;t like
my sheep, evidently, because he knows I keep track of his
whisky selling in this town and keep the law forever hanging
over him. But I&#8217;ve sworn under high heaven to fight
that curse to humanity wherever I find it threatening, and
under high heaven I&#8217;ll do it, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jacobs&#8217; face was the face of a resolute man with whom
law was law. Then the two talked of other things as they
finished their meal.</p>
<p>John Jacobs was city bred, a merchant by instinct, a
Jew in religion, and a strictly honest and exacting business
man. Asher Aydelot had been a country boy and was by
choice a farmer. He was a Protestant of the Methodist
persuasion. It must have been his business integrity that
first attracted Jacobs to him. Jacobs was a timid man, and
no one else in Kansas, not even Doctor Carey, understood
him or appreciated him quite as keenly as Asher Aydelot did.</p>

<p>John Jacobs little realized how true was his estimate
of the firm of &#8220;Champers &amp; Co.&#8221; Nor did he suspect
that at this very minute the firm was in council in the small
room beyond the partition wall&mdash;the &#8220;blind tiger&#8221; of
the Wyker eating-house.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you it&#8217;s our chance,&#8221; Darley Champers was declaring
emphatically. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t hold back your capital
now. This firm isn&#8217;t organized to promote health nor Sunday
Schools nor some other fellow&#8217;s fortune. We are together
for yours truly, every one of us. If you two have
some other games back of your own pocketbooks, they don&#8217;t
cut any against this common purpose. I&#8217;m for business
for Darley Champers. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here. I&#8217;ve got no
love for Doc Carey, ruling men&#8217;s minds like they was all
putty, and him a putty knife to shape &#8217;em finer yet. And
another fellow I&#8217;d like to put down so hard he&#8217;ll never get
over it is that straight-up-and-down farmer, Asher Aydelot
of the Sunflower Ranch, who walks like a military captain,
and works like a hired man, and is so danged independent he
don&#8217;t give a damn for no man&#8217;s opinion of him. If it hadn&#8217;t
been for him we&#8217;d a had the whole Grass River Valley now
to speculate on. I&#8217;m something of a danged fool, but I
knowed this boom was comin&#8217;. I felt it in my craw.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So you always said, Champers,&#8221; Thomas Smith broke
in, &#8220;but it&#8217;s been a century coming. And look at the capital
I&#8217;ve sunk. If you&#8217;d worked that deal through, time of
the drouth in seventy-four, we&#8217;d be in clover and no Careyville
and no Aydelots in the way. I could have saved
Asher&#8217;s little bank stock then, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You could?&#8221; Darley Champers stared at the speaker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if he&#8217;d given up right that first trip of yours down
there. When he refused I knew his breed too well. He&#8217;s
as set and slow and stubborn as his old dad ever was.
That&#8217;s what ailed those two, they were too near alike; and
you&#8217;ll never catch Asher Aydelot bending to our plans now.
I warn you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, but about this bank account?&#8221; Champers queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the fates played the devil with everything in two
weeks. Doc Carey got in with Miss Jane Aydelot down at
Philadelphia, and she came straight to Cloverdale, and,
womanlike, made things so hot there I had to let loose of
everything at once or lose everything I had saved for
myself. Serves her right, for Asher&#8217;s pile went into the
dump, although there&#8217;s naturally no love lost between the
two. But this Miss Jane is Aydelot clear through. She&#8217;s
so honest and darned set you can&#8217;t budge her. But she&#8217;s a
timid woman and so she&#8217;s safe if you keep out of her range.
She won&#8217;t chase you far, but she&#8217;s got fourteen rattles
and a button.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well, let her rattle, and get to pusiness,&#8221; Hans
Wyker demanded. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Champers says he&#8217;s here yust
for pusiness and he wants to get Aydelot and Carey, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen!&#8221; Champers struck the table with his fist.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s play fair now, so&#8217;s not to spoil each other&#8217;s games.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
I&#8217;ll fix Aydelot if it&#8217;s in me to do it, just because he&#8217;s
stood in my way once too often. But he&#8217;s my side line,
him and Carey is. I&#8217;m here for business. Tell me what
you are here for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hans Wyker&#8217;s little eyes were red with pent-up anger
and malice as he burst out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Shentlemen, you know my hart luck. You see where
I be today. I not repeat no tiresome history here. Kansas
yust boomin&#8217;! Wykerton dead! Yon Yacob own all der
groun&#8217; right oop to der corporation line on tree side, an&#8217;
he not sell one inch for attitions to dis town. He say
dere notings to keep town goin&#8217; in two, tree year. What
we care? We be rich by den an&#8217; let it go to der devil.
But he not sell. Den I go mit you and we organize town
company. We mark townsite, we make Grass River sell
to us. We boom! boom! boom! We knock Careyville
from de prairie alretty, mak&#8217; Yon Yacob go back to Cincinnati
where he belong mit his Chews. He damned queer
Chew, but he Chew all de same all right, all right. I want
to down Yon Yacob, an&#8217; I do it if it take tree hundred
fifty years. I&#8217;ll kill him if he get in my way. I hate him.
He run me off my saloon in ol&#8217; Carey Crossin&#8217;; my prewery
goin&#8217; smash mit der damned prohibittery law; he growin&#8217;
rich in Careyville, an&#8217; me!&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice rose to a shriek and he stamped his foot in
rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold your noise, Wyker!&#8221; Champers growled. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
you know who&#8217;s on the other side of that partition?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I built that partition mineself. It&#8217;s von dead noise-breaker,&#8221;
Wyker began. But Champers broke in:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your turn, Smith.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>Dr. Carey had described Smith once as rather small,
with close-set dark eyes and a stiff, half-paralyzed right
arm and wrist, a man who wrote in a cramped left-handed
style. There was a crooked little scar cutting across his
forehead now above the left eye that promised to stay
there for life. He had a way of evading a direct gaze,
suggesting timidity. And when Hans Wyker had threatened
to kill John Jacobs he shivered a little, and for the
instant a gray pallor crept across his face, unnoted by
his companions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We propose to start a town in the Grass River country
that will kill Careyville. We two put up the capital.
You do the buying and selling. We&#8217;ll handle real estate
lively for a few months. We&#8217;ll advertise till we fill the
place with buyers, and we&#8217;ll make our pile right there and
then&mdash;and it&#8217;s all to be done by Darley Champers &amp; Co.
We two are not to be in the open in the game at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thomas Smith spoke deliberately. There seemed to
be none of Champers&#8217; bluster nor Wyker&#8217;s malice in the
third part of the company, or else he was better schooled
in self-control.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have it exactly,&#8221; Champers declared. &#8220;The first
thing is to take in fellows like Jim Shirley and Cyrus
Bennington and Todd Stewart, and Aydelot, if we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if we can, but we can&#8217;t,&#8221; Thomas Smith insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;And having got the land, with or without their knowing
why, we boom her to destruction. But to be fair, now,
why do you want to keep yourself in hiding, and who&#8217;s the
fellow you want to kill?&#8221; Darley Champers said with a
laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I may as well let you know now why I can&#8217;t be known
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
in this,&#8221; Thomas Smith said smoothly, even if the same
gray hue did flit like a shadow a second time across his
countenance&mdash;a thing that did not escape the shrewd eye
of Darley Champers this time.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wyker is pitted against Jacobs. You are after Asher
Aydelot&#8217;s scalp, if you can get it. I must get Jim Shirley,
fair or foul.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s low voice was full of menace, boding more
trouble to his man than the bluster and threat of the other
two could compass.</p>
<p>&#8220;I paid you well, Darley Champers, for all information
concerning Jim when I came here fifteen years ago. I was
acting under orders, and as Jim would have known me
then I had to keep out of sight a little.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Vell, and vot has Shirley ever done mit you that you
so down on him?&#8221; Hans Wyker asked.</p>
<p>The smooth mask did not drop from Smith&#8217;s face,
save that the small dark eyes burned with an intense
glow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you I was acting under orders from Shirley&#8217;s
brother Tank in Cloverdale, Ohio. And if Dr. Carey hadn&#8217;t
been so blamed quick I&#8217;d have gotten a letter Mrs. Tank
Shirley had written to Jim the very day I got to Carey&#8217;s
Crossing. No brother ever endured more from the hands
of a relative than Tank Shirley endured from Jim. In
every way Jim tried to defraud him of his rights; tried
to prejudice their own father against him; tried to rob
him of the girl, a rich girl, too, that he married in spite
Of Jim&mdash;and at last contrived to prejudice his wife against
him, and with Jane Aydelot interfering all the time, like
the old maid that she is, managed to get Tank Shirley&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
only child away from him and given legally to Jim. Do
you wonder Tank hates his brother? You wouldn&#8217;t if I
dared to tell you all of Jim&#8217;s cussedness, but some things
I&#8217;m sworn to secrecy on. That&#8217;s Tank&#8217;s streak of kindness
he can&#8217;t overcome. Gets it from his mother. I&#8217;m his
agent, and I&#8217;m paid for my work. You both understand
me, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We unterstant, an&#8217; we stay py you to der ent,&#8221; Hans
Wyker exclaimed enthusiastically. But Darley Champers
had a different mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll watch you, my man, and I&#8217;ll do business with you
accordin&#8217;,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;Devil knows whether you
are Thomas Smith workin&#8217; for Tank Shirley, or Tank
Shirley workin&#8217; for hisself under a assoomed name. Long as
I get your capital to push my business I don&#8217;t care who
you are.&#8221; Aloud he remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s how Jim Shirley got that little girl. She&#8217;s
a comely youngun, anyhow. But Smith, since you are
only an agent and nobody knows it but us, why keep
yourself so secret? Where&#8217;s the harm in letting Shirley
lay eyes on you? Why not come out into the open?
How&#8217;ll Shirley know you from the Mayor of Wilmington,
Delaware, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thomas Smith&#8217;s face was ashy and his voice was hoarse
with anger as he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;m not now from Wilmington, Delaware, any
more than I ever was. I&#8217;m from Cloverdale, Ohio. You
know, Wyker, how I lost money in your brewery, investing
in machinery and starting the thing, only to go to smash
on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned on Hans fiercely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you know how I lost by you in this town and the
land around it. It was my money took up all this ground
to help build up Wykerton and you, as my agent, sold
every acre of it to Jacobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>This as fiercely as Darley Champers.</p>
<p>Both men nodded and Darley broke in:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was honest. I thought Jacobs was gettin&#8217; it to boom
Wykerton with, or I&#8217;d never sold. And him bein&#8217; right
here was a danged sight easier&#8217;n havin&#8217; some man in
Wilmington, Delaware, to write to. That&#8217;s why I let him
in on three sides, appealin&#8217; to his pride.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Thomas Smith stopped him abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold on! You need money to push your schemes
now. And I&#8217;m the one who does the financing for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both men agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s death to either of you if you ever tell a
word of this. You understand that? I&#8217;m not to be known
here because I&#8217;m a dead man. I&#8217;m the cashier that was
mixed up in the Cloverdale bank affair. And, as I say, if
Jane Aydelot had let things alone Tank Shirley and I
could have pulled out honorably, but, womanlike, because
she had a lot of bank stock and was the biggest loser of
anybody, in her own mind, she pushed things where a man
would not have noticed or kept still, and she kept pushing
year after year. Damn a woman, anyhow! All I could
do at last was to commit suicide. Tank planned it. It
saved me and helped Tank. You see, Miss Jane had a line
around his neck, too. She was the only one who really
saw me go down and she spread the report that I&#8217;d committed
suicide on account of the bank failure. So, gentlemen,
I&#8217;m really drowned in Clover Creek right above where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
the railroad grade that cuts the Aydelot farm reaches the
water.&#8221;</p>
<p>Darley Champers wondered why Thomas Smith was so
particular in his description.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve known Jim Shirley all my life. He was as bad a
boy as ever left Cloverdale, Ohio, under a cloud. Got into
trouble over some girl, I believe, finally. But you can see
why I&#8217;m out of this game when it comes to the open. And
maybe you could understand, if you knew the brothers as
well as I do, why Tank keeps me after him. And I&#8217;ll get
him yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>The vengeance of the last words was venomous.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now we understand each other we&#8217;ll not be tramping
on anybody&#8217;s corns,&#8221; Darley Champers urged, anxious
to get away from the subject.</p>
<p>With all of his shortcomings he was a man of different
mould from the other men. Eagerness to represent and
invest large capital and to make by far the best of a bargain
by any means just inside the law were his besetments.
But he had not the unremitting hatred that enslaved
Thomas Smith and Hans Wyker.</p>
<p>Champers&#8217; store of energy seemed exhaustless. Following
this council he fell upon the Grass River Valley and
threshed it to his profit.</p>
<p>One mid-June evening the Grass River schoolhouse was
lighted early, while up from the prairie ranches came the
work-worn farmers.</p>
<p>This year the crop outlook was bad, yet somehow an
expectant spirit lifted sagging shoulders and looked out
through hopeful eyes.</p>
<p>While the men exchanged neighborly greetings, a group
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
of children, the second generation in the valley, romped
about in the twilight outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes Thaine,&#8221; they shouted as Asher Aydelot
and his boy came down the trail.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Thaine,&#8221; Leigh Shirley said, reaching for
his hand. &#8220;We are going to play drop the handkerchief.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine&#8217;s going to stand by me,&#8221; pretty Jo Bennington
declared, pushing Leigh boisterously aside.</p>
<p>Josephine, the week-old baby Mrs. Aydelot had gone to
see one day nine years ago, had grown into a big, black-eyed,
rosy-cheeked girl who lorded it over every other
child in the neighborhood. And every other child submitted
except Leigh Shirley, who had a quiet habit of
going straight ahead about her affairs in a way that vexed
the pretty Jo not a little. From the first coming of Leigh
among the children Jo had resented her independence. But,
young as they all were, she objected most to Thaine
Aydelot&#8217;s claiming Leigh as his playmate. Thaine was
Jo&#8217;s idol from earliest memory.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the row here?&#8221; Todd Stewart, Junior, broke
in. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t fuss or you&#8217;ll all have to go in and
listen to Darley Champers and I&#8217;ll play out here by myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Todd was a young-hearted, half-grown boy now, able
to work all day in the hayfield or to romp like a child with
younger children in the evening. He was half a dozen
years older than Thaine and Jo, a difference that would
tend to disappear by the end of a decade.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be good, Toddie, if you&#8217;ll let us stay and you&#8217;ll
play with us,&#8221; the children entreated, and the game began,
with Thaine between Leigh and Jo.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>When Asher Aydelot joined the group inside Darley
Champers rapped on the desk and called the men to order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, let&#8217;s have a businesslike proceeding,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Who shall preside at the meeting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I move Jim Shirley be made chairman. He&#8217;s the best
looking man here,&#8221; Todd Stewart said, half seriously.</p>
<p>The motion carried and Jim, looking big and handsome
and kindly as always, took the chair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll ask Mr. Champers to state the purpose of the
meeting,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; Champers began with tremendous dignity,
&#8220;I represent the firm of the Champers Town Company,
just chartered, with half a million dollars&#8217; capital. Gentlemen,
you have the finest valley in Kansas.&#8221;</p>
<p>The same was said of every other valley in Kansas in
the fat years of the boom. But to do Darley justice, he
had never made a finer effort in his life of many efforts
than he was bent on making tonight.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this site is the garden spot of it all,&#8221; he continued.
&#8220;The elevation, the water power at the deep bend
of Grass River (where at that moment only a trace of
water marked the river&#8217;s grassy right of way), the fine
farming land&mdash;everything ready for a sudden leap into
prosperity. And, gentlemen, the A. and T. (Arctic and
Tropic) North and South Railroad will begin grading
down this very stream inside of thirty days. A town here
this year will be a city next year, a danged sight bigger
city than Careyville will ever be. Why, that town&#8217;s got
its growth and is beginning to decay right now. The
A. and T. will miss it comin&#8217; south, by ten mile.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused and looked at the men before him. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
were farmers, drooped to rest after the long summer day&#8217;s
work, yet they listened with intense eagerness. Only Asher
Aydelot sat in easy dignity, looking straight at Darley
Champers with steady interest. The four years&#8217; training
in the University of the Civil War had not been overcome
by his hold on the plow handles. And no farmer will grow
hopelessly stooped in shoulders and sad of countenance
who lifts his face often from the clods beneath his feet
to the stars above his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;You all know crops was poor last year and only
moderately promisin&#8217; this year,&#8221; Champers continued.
&#8220;But this is temporary and you are stayers, as I can testify.
The Champers Town Company is ready to locate a
townsite and start a town right here at the deep bend of
Grass River. We propose to plat the prairie into town
lots with a public square for the courthouse and sites for
the railroad station and grain elevators, a big hotel, an
opera house, and factories and foundries that&#8217;s bound to
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>The speaker paused a moment. Then the inspiration of
the evening came to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you first came here, Aydelot, there wasn&#8217;t nothing
but imagination to make this a farming community.
And it looked lots more impossible then than this looks to
me now. What&#8217;s to prevent a metropolis risin&#8217; right here
where a decade and a half ago there wasn&#8217;t nothing but
bare prairie?&#8221;</p>
<p>The appeal was forceful, and the very men who had
stood like heroes against hardships and had fought poverty
with a grim, unyielding will-power, the same men fell now
before Darley Champers&#8217; smooth advances.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Our company&#8217;s chartered with no end of stock for sale
now that in six months will be out of sight above par and
can&#8217;t be bought for no price. It&#8217;s your time to invest now.
You can easy mortgage your farms to raise the money,
seein&#8217; you can knock the mortgage off so quick and have
abundance left over, if you use your heads &#8217;stead of your
tired legs to make money out of your land.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cyrus Bennington and Todd Stewart and Jim Shirley,
with others, were sitting upright with alert faces now.
Booms were making men rich all over Kansas. Why should
prosperity not come to this valley as well? It was not
impossible, surely. Only the unpleasant memory of
Champers&#8217; holding back the supplies in the days when the
grasshopper was a burden would intrude on the minds of
the company tonight. Champers was shrewd to remember
also, and he played his game daringly as well as cautiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe some of you fellows haven&#8217;t felt right toward
me sometimes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hate to tell it now, but justice
is justice. The truth is, it was a friend of yours who
advised me not to let any supplies come your way, time of
the grasshopper raid. I listened to him then and didn&#8217;t
know no better&#8217;n to be run by him till I see his scheme to
kill Wykerton an&#8217; build a town for hisself. He&#8217;ll deny
it now, declare he never done it, and he&#8217;ll not do a thing
for your town down here. See if he does. But it&#8217;s Gawd&#8217;s
truth, he held me back so&#8217;s he could run you his way. It&#8217;s
your turn to listen to me now and believe me, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>And well they listened, especially the men who still owed
John Jacobs for the loan of 1874.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can have a boom right here that&#8217;ll make you all
rich men inside of a year. Why not turn capitalists
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
yourselves for a while, you hard-working farmers. Money is
easy and credit long, now. Take your chance at it and
make five hundred per cent on your investments. I&#8217;m
ready to take subscriptions for stock in this new town right
now. Why not stop this snail&#8217;s pace of earnin&#8217; and go to
livin&#8217; like gentlemen&mdash;like some Careyville men I know
who own hundreds of acres they never earned and they
won&#8217;t improve so&#8217;s to help others?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right there,&#8221; a farmer sitting beside Asher
Aydelot called out. &#8220;We all know how Careyville got
her start. It&#8217;s kept some of us poor doing it. I&#8217;ll invest
in Town Company stock right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asher Aydelot turned toward the speaker in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jacobs helped you out as well as the rest of us in the
drouth and grasshopper time of seventy-four,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;What&#8217;s your grievance against him now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and hung onto me like a leech of a Jew ever
since,&#8221; the man muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you never paid either interest or principal.
And Jacobs has carried you along and waited your time,&#8221;
Asher asserted frankly.</p>
<p>But the farmer plunged into the discussion again, not
realizing that his grudge against Careyville was the outgrowth
of his own shortcomings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take this site right here in the middle of your neighborhood
where you&#8217;ve already got your church and your
schoolhouse, and your graveyard,&#8221; Champers declared.
&#8220;Aydelot here gave part of it and Pryor Gaines the rest.
Gaines don&#8217;t farm it any more himself, it&#8217;s most too big
a job for a man of brains like him. And that quarter across
the river that used to be all sand, you own that now,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
Aydelot, don&#8217;t you? What did you think of doin&#8217; with it
now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll set it in alfalfa this fall,&#8221; Asher replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, now these two make the very site we want.
You are lucky, for you are ready right now to start things.
How much stock do you want, Aydelot, and how will you
sell?&#8221;</p>
<p>As Asher listened he seemed to see the whole scheme of
the town builder bare itself before him, and he wondered
at the credulity of his neighbors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, standing before them, &#8220;it is a
hard thing to put yourself against neighborhood sentiment
and not seem to be selfish. But as I was the first man
in this valley and have known every man who settled here
since, I ought to be well enough known to you to need no
certificate of good moral character here. I offer no criticism
on the proposition before you. You are as capable
of judging as I am. The end may show you more capable,
but I decline to buy stock, or to donate, or sell any land
for a townsite at the deep bend of Grass River. A man&#8217;s
freehold is his own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asher&#8217;s influence had led in Grass River affairs for years.
But Darley Champers had the crowd in the hollow of his
paw tonight.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about Gaines?&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;You join him
on the south. You ought to know some of his notions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gaines has no land to consider,&#8221; Asher said frankly.
&#8220;He sold it more than a year ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the Jew foreclosed on the preacher, don&#8217;t
you?&#8221; someone said sarcastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to ask the preacher,&#8221; Asher replied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
good-naturedly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t understand it so at the time. But
as for myself, I&#8217;m no boomer. I stand for the prosperity
that builds from day to day, and stays built. The values
here are in the soil, not in the shining bubbles that glitter
and burst on top of it. You&#8217;ll have to count me out of
your scheme. I&#8217;m a farmer still. So I&#8217;ll wish you all good
luck and good night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, I must go with papa,&#8221; Thaine Aydelot
said, springing up from his play outside.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;ve got to stay here. Hold him, Leigh,&#8221; Jo
Bennington commanded, clutching at Thaine&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>Leigh sat calmly disobedient.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s his papa&#8217;s boy, I guess, and he ought to go,&#8221;
she asserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You meany, meany,&#8221; Jo whispered, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like you.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Leigh paid little heed to her opinion.</p>
<p>As Asher passed out of the room there was an ugly look
in Darley Champers&#8217; eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;No more ambition than a cat. One of them quiet,
good-natured fellers that are as stubborn as the devil once
they take a stand. Just a danged clod-hopper farmer, but
he don&#8217;t leave no enemies behind him. That&#8217;s enough to
make any man hate him. He&#8217;s balked twice when I tried
to drive. I&#8217;ll not be fooled by him always.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Champers thought as he watched Asher Aydelot walk
out of the room. And in the silence that followed his
going the company heard him through the open window
whistling some old patriotic air as he strode away in the
June moonlight with little Thaine trotting beside him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shirley, where is Pryor tonight?&#8221; Cyrus Bennington
broke the silence with the query.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t get him to come; said he had no land for
sale nor money to invest,&#8221; Jim replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Jacobs got him at last. Fine friend to you
fellers, that man Jacobs. Easy to see what he wants. He
ain&#8217;t boomin&#8217; no place but Careyville,&#8221; Champers snarled.
&#8220;But the deep bend ain&#8217;t the only bend in Grass River.
Or do you want to shove prosperity away when it comes
right to your door?&#8221;</p>
<p>Nobody wants to do that. Least of all did the Kansas
settlers of the boom days turn away from the promise of
a fortune.</p>
<p>So the boom came to the Grass River Valley as other
disasters had come before it. Where a decade and a half
ago Asher and Virginia Aydelot had lived alone with each
other and God, in the heart of the wide solitary wilderness,
the town of Cloverdale was staked out now over the prairie.</p>
<p>Stock in the new venture sold rapidly, and nobody ever
knew how much clear profit came to Champers &amp; Co. from
this venture. A big slice of the Cloverdale ranch went into
the staking of the new city, and prosperity seemed wedded
to Jim Shirley. He ceased farming and became a speculator
with dreams of millions in his brain. Other settlers
followed his example until the fever had infected every man
in the community except Asher Aydelot, who would not
give up to it, and Pryor Gaines, who had nothing to
give up.</p>
<p>Everything fell out as advertised. The railroad grade
swelled up like a great welt across the land, seemingly in
a day. Suburban additions radiated for miles in every
direction. Bonds were voted for light and water and public
buildings and improvements. Speculators rushed to invest
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
and unload their investments at a profit. The Grass River
Farmers&#8217; Company built the Grass River Creamery. And
because it looked big and good they built the Grass River
Sugar Factory and the Grass River Elevator. But while
they were building their money into stone and machinery
they forgot to herd cattle to supply the creamery and to
grow cane for the sugar product and to sow and reap grain
to be elevated.</p>
<p>Also, the Cloverdale Farmers&#8217; Company, made up mostly
of the members of the Grass River Farmers&#8217; Company,
built the Cloverdale Hotel, and the Cloverdale State Bank,
and the Cloverdale Office Block. And the sad part of it
all was that mortgaged and doubly mortgaged farms and
not the price of crops had furnished the capital for the
boom building.</p>
<p>It is an old story now, and none too interesting&mdash;the
story of a boom town, founded on prairie breezes and built
out of fortune seekers&#8217; dreams.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Asher Aydelot, watching the sudden easy
prosperity of his neighbors, fought down the temptation
to join them and resolutely strove with the soil for its
best yield. The drouth and hot winds had not forgotten
all their old tricks, and even the interest on his mortgage
could not be met promptly sometimes. Yet with the same
old Aydelot tenacity with which his father had held Cloverdale
in Ohio away from the old farm beside the National
pike road, the son of this father held the boundary of
the Sunflower Ranch intact, nor yielded up one acre to be
platted into a suburban addition to the new Cloverdale in
the Grass River Valley in Kansas. And all the while the
Aydelot windbreaks strengthened; the Aydelot grove struck
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
deeper root; the long corn furrows and the acres on acres
of broken wheat stubble of the Sunflower Ranch wooed the
heavier rainfall, narrowing the sand dunes and deepening
the water courses.</p>
<p>For two brief years Cloverdale, in the Grass River Valley
in Kansas, had a name, even in the Eastern money markets.
Speculation became madness; and riotous commercialism
had its little hour of strut and rave.</p>
<p>Then the bubble burst, and all that the boom had promised
fell to nothingness. Many farms were mortgaged,
poor crops worked tribulation, taxes began to eat up acres
of weed-grown vacant town lots, Eastern money was withdrawn
to other markets, speculators departed, the strange
enthusiasm burned itself out, and the Wilderness came again
to the Grass River Valley. Not the old Wilderness of loneliness,
and drouth, and grasshoppers, and prairie fires that
had dared the pioneer to conquest; but the Prairie, waiting
again the kingly hand on the plow handle, gave no quarter
to him whom the gilded boom had lured to shipwreck.</p>

<p>The twilight had fallen on the prairie. Grass River,
running bank full from the heavy May rains, lay
like a band of molten silver glistening in the after-sunset
light. The draw, once choked with wild plum bushes in the
first days of the struggle in the wilderness, was the outlet
now to the little lake that nestled in the heart of the
Aydelot grove. The odors of early summer came faintly
on the soft twilight breeze. Somewhere among the cottonwoods
a bird called a tender good-night to its mate. Upon
the low swell the lights were beginning to twinkle from the
windows of the Aydelot home, and the sounds of voices
and of hurrying footsteps told of something unusual going
on within. Asher Aydelot, driving down the old Grass
River trail, saw from far away the windows of his home
beginning to glow like beacons in the twilight. Beyond it
was the glimmer of the waters of the river and before it
spread the mile-long grove, dim and shadowy in the mist-folds
rising up from the prairie.</p>
<p>&#8220;A man can win a kingdom in the West, I told my
mother one spring evening long ago,&#8221; he murmured as his
eyes took in the view. &#8220;It&#8217;s surely more like a kingdom
now than it was when we came down this trail a quarter of
a century ago. Twenty-five good years of life, but it&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
worth the effort, and we are just now at the opening of our
best years. A man&#8217;s real usefulness begins at fifty. This
is more like a kingdom, too, than it was ten years ago
when those old hulks of wrecks that strew the prairie down
the river were banks, and hotels, and opera houses, and
factories of boomed-up Cloverdale. We are doing something
for the land. I hope our boy will make up his mind
to want to keep it when his time comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>He lifted his head bravely, as if to throw off all doubt,
and tightening the reins on his horses he swung away
down the trail toward the home lights shining in the
gathering gloom.</p>
<p>As he neared the house Thaine Aydelot leaped from
the side porch and hurried toward him. Climbing into the
moving wagon, he put one hand affectionately on his
father&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know whose birthday this is?&#8221; he inquired
with serious countenance, &#8220;and you&#8217;ve not spoken to me
all day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know my boy is nineteen today and expects to have
a birthday party here tonight, and that I left him asleep
when I started to town this forenoon about nine o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nine cats! You left at six sharp to go with John
Jacobs over to Wolf Creek after what you never got,
judging from this empty wagon. And I had half of the
feeding done when you left the house here. I saw you
when I was out by the old stone corral looking after the
pigs, but they squealed so loud you could not hear me
telling you good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All pigs squeal alike to me,&#8221; Asher began, but Thaine
choked him to silence.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hurry up and get togged out for the party,&#8221; he
urged. &#8220;The Benningtons will be over early. Jo&#8217;s been
here all day. I&#8217;ll take care of the horses. Hike!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be sure to rub them down. They had to pull hard
today,&#8221; Asher called back as he went up the walk toward
the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, fiddle! Always take care of a horse like it was a
prize poodle. Farms like he was decorating chinaware.
Good enough dad, but too particular. Me for the State
University and the professional or military life. This
ranch is all right for Asher Aydelot, but it&#8217;s pretty blamed
slow for T. A. And Jo Bennington doesn&#8217;t like a farm
either,&#8221; he added with a smile.</p>
<p>In the superiority of his youth Thaine fumed at his
father&#8217;s commands, but failed not to obey them. He was
just nineteen, as tall as his father, and brawny with the
strength of the outdoors life of the prairie ranch. Strength
of character was not expressed in his face so much as the
promise of strength with the right conditions for its development
in future days. His features were his mother&#8217;s
set in masculine lines, with the same abundant dark hair,
the same lustrous dark eyes, the same straight nose and
well-formed chin. The same imperious will of all the
Thaines to do as he chose was his heritage, too, and he
walked the prairies like a king.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real story of the plains is the story of the second
generation; the real romance here will be Thaine Aydelot&#8217;s
romance, for he was born here.&#8221;</p>
<p>So Virginia Aydelot had declared on the day she had
gone to visit the Bennington baby, Josephine, and coming
home had met Asher with little Thaine beside Mercy

Pennington&#8217;s grave. Sorrow for the dead had become a tender
memory that day, and joy in the living made life full of
hope.</p>
<p>In Virginia&#8217;s mind a pretty romance was begun in which
Thaine and Josephine were central figures. For mothers
will evermore weave romances for their children so long
as the memory of their own romance lives.</p>
<p>The time of the second generation came swiftly, even
before the wilderness of the father&#8217;s day had been driven
entirely from the prairie. Some compensation for the loss
of eastern advantages belonged to the simple life of the
plains children. If they lacked the culture of city society
they were also without its frivolity and temptations. What
the prairies denied them in luxuries they matched with a
resourcefulness to meet their needs. Something of the
breadth of the landscape and of the free sweeping winds
of heaven gave them breadth and power to look the world
squarely in the face, and to measure it at its true value,
when their hour for action came.</p>
<p>The Grass River children could ride like Plains Indians.
They could cut a steer out of a herd and prevent or escape
a stampede. They had no fear of distance, nor storm, nor
prairie fire, nor blizzard. Because their opportunities were
few, they squandered them the less. Matched against the
city-bred young folks their talents differed in kind, not in
number, nor in character-value.</p>
<p>Tonight the Aydelots were to give a party in honor of
Thaine&#8217;s birthday, and the farmhouse was dressed for the
occasion. Thaine had been busy all day carrying furniture
in or out, mowing the front lawn where the old double
fireguard once lay, and fixing a seat under the white
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
honeysuckle trellis, &#8220;for the afflicted ones,&#8221; he declared to pretty
Jo Bennington. Jo&#8217;s blush was becoming. Thaine felt
sure that he must be in love with her. All the other boys
were, too, he knew that well enough.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on in the dining room?&#8221; Asher asked,
as he sat at supper with Virginia in the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;The decorating committee is fixing it up for dancing.
Bo Peep is coming with his fiddle and there&#8217;ll be a sound
of revelry by night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s the decorating committee?&#8221; Asher inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jo Bennington is helping Thaine, and our new hired
girl, Rosie Gimpke, from over on Little Wolf. She came
this morning just after you left,&#8221; Virginia replied. &#8220;She
acts and looks like she&#8217;d never had a kind word spoken to
her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rosie Gimpke must be Hans Wyker&#8217;s granddaughter.
There&#8217;s a nest of them over on Little Wolf. They give
John Jacobs no end of trouble, but you must have help,&#8221;
Asher said thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Virginia&#8217;s mind was not on hired help, however, as the
sound of laughter came from the dining room.</p>
<p>&#8220;The bridal wreath and snowballs make it look like a
wedding was expected in there,&#8221; she declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will the Arnolds and the Archibalds be up? Have you
heard from the Spoopendykes and the Gilliwigs?&#8221; Asher
inquired with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Asher! What a change since the days when we
invented parties for our lonely evenings here! What has
become of the old prairie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s out there still, under the wheat fields. We have
driven the wilderness back; plowed a fireguard around the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
whole valley; tempered the hot winds by windbreaks and
groves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems impossible that there ever was a one-room
sod cabin here, and only you and I and Jim and faithful old
Pilot in all the valley.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since so many things have come true it may be that
many more will also by the time Thaine is as old as I was
when I came out here and thought the Lord had forgotten
all about this prairie until I reminded Him of it. We can
almost forget the hard work and the waiting for results,&#8221;
Asher said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we don&#8217;t want to forget,&#8221; Virginia replied. &#8220;Not
a season&#8217;s joy or sorrow but had its uses for us. Do you
remember that first supper here and the sunflowers in the
old tin can?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and Jim sitting outside so lonely. What a blessing
Leigh has been to his life. There they come now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next moment Jim&#8217;s tall form filled the doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good evening, folks. I can&#8217;t resist the habit of the
sod shack days to come right into the kitchen. I understand
that we forty-niners are to have an old settlers&#8217;
reunion while the young folks dance,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There were lines of care on his face now, suggesting a
bodily weariness that might never grow less. The old
hopefulness and purpose seemed fading away. But the
kindly light of the eyes had not disappeared, nor the direct
gaze of an honest man whose judgment might bring him
to tragedy, while his sense of honor was still sublime.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, Jim. Where are Pryor and Leigh? Did
you take it you were all we expected?&#8221; Asher asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leigh went in the front door like a Christian. As to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
Pryor,&#8221; he hesitated a moment. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you later about
him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Take this chair. I must help the children,&#8221; Virginia
said cordially as she rose and left the kitchen.</p>
<p>Leigh Shirley was coming from the front hall as she
entered the dining room, and Virginia paused a moment
to look at her. Something about Leigh made most people
want more than a glance. Tonight, as she stood in the
doorway, Virginia could think of nothing but the pink
roses that grew in the rose garden of the old Thaine mansion
house of her girlhood. A vision swept across her
memory of Asher Aydelot&mdash;just Thaine&#8217;s age then&mdash;of
a moonlit night, sweet with the odor of many blossoms,
and the tinkling waters of the fountain in the rose garden,
and herself a happy young girl.</p>
<p>Leigh&#8217;s fair face was set in the golden brown shadows
of her hair. On either side of her square white forehead
the sunny ripples kept the only memory of the golden
curls of babyhood. The darker eyebrows and heavy lashes
and the deep violet-blue eyes, the pink bloom of the cheeks,
and the resolute mouth gave to Leigh&#8217;s face all the charm
of the sweet young girl. But the deeper charm that
claimed the steady gaze lay in the spirit back of the face,
in the self-reliance and penetrating power, combined with
something of the artist&#8217;s dreams; and swayed altogether
by genuine good nature and good will.</p>
<p>Tonight she wore a simple white gown revealing her
white throat and the line of her neck and shoulder. White
flowers nestled in the folds of her hair, and the whole effect
enhanced the dainty coloring of cheeks and lips. Leigh
had an artist&#8217;s eye in dress and knew by instinct what to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
wear. She had an artist&#8217;s hand also, as her mother had
had before her, and was far more skilled in the painting of
prairie landscapes than any of the Grass River folk
dreamed of.</p>
<p>Thaine was busy on the top of the stepladder and did
not see Leigh as she came in. Jo Bennington, who was
holding sprays of spirea for him to festoon above the
window, stared at Leigh until Thaine, waiting for the
flowers, turned to see the pink-cheeked living picture framed
against the shadows of the hall behind her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were coming early to help us. This
Gimpke girl doesn&#8217;t know how to do a thing,&#8221; Jo exclaimed.</p>
<p>If her voice was a trifle high-pitched it was not out of
keeping with her brilliant coloring and dashing manners.
Even the thoughtless rebuke of the Gimpke girl seemed
excusable from her lips, and Rosie Gimpke looked at her
with unblinking eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can put on my apron and finish, but don&#8217;t change
a thing, now mind. I&#8217;ll go and dress. I brought my
whole wardrobe over early in the week,&#8221; Jo rattled on, and
thrusting her gingham apron into Leigh&#8217;s hands she dashed
through the hall toward the stairway.</p>
<p>Rosie Gimpke, the tow-headed image of her mother,
Gretchen Wyker, stared at Leigh, who smiled back at her.
Rosie was stupid and ignorant, but she knew the difference
between Jo Bennington&#8217;s frown and Leigh Shirley&#8217;s smile.
A saving thing, the smile of good will, and worth its cost
in any market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I help you too, or shall Rosie and I look after
the refreshments?&#8221; Virginia asked as she greeted Leigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, run along and get dressed. Rosie knows just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
how to fix things in the kitchen, and I never need anybody
else if Leigh can help me,&#8221; Thaine declared. &#8220;How is
this, Leigh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh gave a quick glance and answered:
&#8220;Too heavy everywhere? Can we fix it right?&#8221;
&#8220;You bet we can. I&#8217;m not going to have a thing wrong
tonight,&#8221; Thaine answered her. &#8220;But Jo fixed it, and
you know Jo.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh made no reply, but went about the rearrangement
with swift artistic skill; while Jo, who had changed her
mind about being in a hurry, slipped down stairs to the
dining room again. At the doorway she discovered the
undoing of her work. For a minute or two she watched
the pair, then passed unnoticed up stairs again. Leigh
Shirley was the only girl who ever dared to oppose Jo,
and she did it so quietly and completely that Jo could
only ignore her. She could not retaliate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jo Bennington, you are the prettiest girl in Kansas,
and I claim the first dance and the last, and some in-betweens,
right now,&#8221; Thaine declared when she appeared again.</p>
<p>Jo was tall and graceful and imperious in her manner.
The oldest and handsomest child in a large family, she had
had her own way at home and with her associates all her
life. Her world was made to give way to her from the
beginning, until nothing seemed possible or popular without
her sanction. Tonight her heavy black hair was coiled
in braids about her head, her black eyes were full of
youthful glow and her cheeks were like June roses. She
wore a pink lawn dress vastly becoming to her style, and
a string of old-fashioned pearl beads was wound through
her dark braids.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better make amends for spoiling all my pretty
work as you and Leigh have done,&#8221; she said in reply to
Thaine&#8217;s frank compliment. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make it a few more
dances, for you do dance better than any of the other
boys&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Except Todd Stewart, Junior,&#8221; the owner of the name,
who had just come in, declared. &#8220;There is to be a birthday
party and an old settlers&#8217; meeting, and maybe a French
duel or two before midnight. I remember when I was the
only kid in the Grass River Valley. There were others at
first, but I always thought the grasshoppers or Darley
Champers ate &#8217;em. And Jo is the first white girl baby
born in captivity here. We&#8217;ll lead the opening of this ball
or shoot up the ranch. You can have Jo for the last
dance, Thaine, my son, but me first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s fine,&#8221; Jo declared as Thaine was about to
protest. &#8220;Serves you right for spoiling my decorations.
But, Thaine, I claim you for the in-betweens and the last.
Let&#8217;s take one more look at the refreshments&mdash;that Gimpke
girl may have them all in a mess by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a rush for the kitchen, where Leigh Shirley
was already showing Rosie how to keep the table of dishes
in order.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Asher Aydelot had gone out to the seat
Thaine had put up under the honeysuckle trellis.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is early for the crowd, Virgie. Come here and
watch Boanerges Peeperville tuning up,&#8221; Asher Aydelot
said as Virginia stood on the veranda a little later.</p>
<p>She came out to the seat under a bower of sweet white
honeysuckle and sat down beside her husband.</p>
<p>&#8220;The same Bo Peep of the old Virginia days, only he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
was a half-grown boy then,&#8221; she said, watching the Negro
bending above his violin. &#8220;How faithfully he has served
Dr. Carey all these years. He&#8217;s past forty now. Asher,
we are all getting along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With a boy nineteen tonight, how can it be otherwise?&#8221;
Asher replied. &#8220;But when the Careyville crowd
gets here I&#8217;m going to ask you for a dance, anyhow, Miss
Thaine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia stood in the moonlight and looked out over
the prairie slumbering in a silver-broidered robe of evening
mist.</p>
<p>&#8220;How fast the years have gone. Do you remember the
night in the old Thaine home in Virginia when you were
our guest&mdash;too sick to dance?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>Asher caught her arm and drew her to the seat beside
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember the jessamine vines and the arbor at the
end of the rose garden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not old until we forget our own romance days,&#8221;
Virginia said. &#8220;You were my hero that night. You are
my hero still.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even with a son as old now as I was that night?
The real romance of the prairie, you&#8217;ve said it often,
Virgie, is Thaine Aydelot&#8217;s romance. There&#8217;s little chance
for the rest of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>The coming of the guests just then called the host and
hostess to the parlor, and the evening&#8217;s festivities began.</p>
<p>In the building of the Aydelot home there was a memory
of the old farmhouse beside the National pike road in
Ohio and the old Thaine mansion house of the South. The
picture the mirage had revealed to Virginia Aydelot on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
the afternoon when she rode the long lonely miles from
Wykerton with John Jacob&#8217;s message of hope in her
keeping&mdash;that wonderful mirage picture had grown
toward a reality with the slowly winning years. Tonight,
with the lighted rooms and the music of the violin, and the
sound of laughter and the rhythm of dancing feet, and
outside the May moonlight on the veranda with its vine-draped
columns, and the big elm trees throwing long
shadows down the lawn, with the odor of plowed fields and
blossoming grain and shrub mingled with the perfume
floating from the creamy catalpa blooms in the shadowy
grove, all made a picture not unworthy to hang beside the
painting of an Ohio landscape or an old Virginia mansion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where the forty-niners get the best of it,&#8221; Jim
Shirley declared, as the older men gathered about the
veranda steps. &#8220;We&#8217;re dead certain of ourselves now.
We&#8217;re not like those youngsters in there with their battles
before &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been such a gathering as this in ten years.
Not since the night Darley Champers herded us into the
schoolhouse and blew a boom down our throats through
a goosequill,&#8221; Cyrus Bennington declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;See that black thing away across the prairie east of
Aydelot&#8217;s grove. Wait till the moon gets out from that
cloud. Now!&#8221; Todd Stewart directed the eyes of all to
a tall black object distinct in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the Cloverdale Farmers&#8217; Company&#8217;s elevator.
Looks like a lighthouse stretching up in that sea of wheat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There are plenty of derelicts in that sea as well as
some human derelicts left afloat,&#8221; Jim said, with a laugh.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s take the census.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Begin with Darley Champers,&#8221; Asher suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not present. Who got his excuse?&#8221; Jim inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;He sent it by me,&#8221; Horace Carey spoke up. &#8220;Business
still keeping him busy. He&#8217;s a humane man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Up to a point he is,&#8221; John Jacobs broke in. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
be fair. He is a large-sized boomer and a small-sized rascal.
A few deals won&#8217;t bear the light of day, but mainly they
are inside the law. I&#8217;ve let him handle all but my grazing
land around Wykerton. He&#8217;s done well by me. But he&#8217;s
been at his line a quarter of a century and he&#8217;ll end where
he began&mdash;in a real estate office over in Wykerton, trying
to get something for nothing and calling it business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Horace Carey?&#8221; Jim Shirley called next.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here,&#8221; Carey replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a big H,&#8221; Todd Stewart declared. &#8220;Same doctor
of the old school. Why don&#8217;t you get married or take a
trip to India, Doctor? Not that we aren&#8217;t satisfied all over
with you as you are, though, and wouldn&#8217;t hear to your
doing either one. You belong to all of us now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I may have a call to a bigger practice some day, a
service that will make you proud of your former honorable
townsman. At present I&#8217;m satisfied,&#8221; Carey said, with a
smile.</p>
<p>Four years later the men remembered this reply and the
attractive face of the speaker, the sound of his voice, and
the whole magnetic presence of the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;John Jacobs?&#8221; Shirley called next.</p>
<p>&#8220;The merchant prince of Careyville,&#8221; Asher Aydelot
declared. &#8220;The money-loaning Shylock. Didn&#8217;t let the
boom so much as turn one hair black or white. Land
owner and stock raiser of the Wolf Creek Valley and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
hater of saloons seven days in the week. Whatever it may
mean in New York and Cincinnati and Chicago, being a
Jew means being a gentleman in this corner of Kansas,&#8221;
Asher was running on, till John Jacobs threw a chair
cushion at his head and Jim called out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Cyrus Bennington.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Busted by the boom. Lived at the public crib ever
since. Held every little county office possible to get, asking
now for your votes this fall for County Treasurer. Will
end his days seeking an election and go at last to be with
the elected,&#8221; Cyrus Bennington frankly described himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so bad yet as Todd Stewart,&#8221; Todd declared.
&#8220;He lost everything in the boom except his old Scotch
Presbyterian faith. Now head clerk in J. Jacobs&#8217; dry
goods and general merchandise store. Had the good sense,
though, this old Todd did, to send his son back to the land
and make a farmer out of him, and the second generation
of Stewarts in this valley promises to make it yet. Why
don&#8217;t you revert to the soil, too, Bennington?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Todd is doing well with his leases,&#8221; Asher Aydelot
declared. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be a landowner yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My family, especially the girls, object to living on a
farm,&#8221; Cyrus Bennington said gravely. &#8220;They have
notions of city life I can&#8217;t overcome. Jo especially dislikes
the country and Jo runs things round the Bennington
place.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;James Shirley, Esquire,&#8221; Jim announced and added
quickly:</p>
<p>&#8220;The biggest sucker in the booming gang. Lost his
farm to the Champers Company. Holds a garden patch
and homestead only, where once the Cloverdale Ranch
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
smiled. All under mortgage also to other capitalists.
Boys, I&#8217;d be ready to give up if it wasn&#8217;t for my little
girl. What&#8217;s the use in a man as big as I am, with no
lung power, keeping at it?&#8221; There was a sad hopelessness
in Shirley&#8217;s tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; the men chorused in one voice. &#8220;Go on,
Jim, go on!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Asher Aydelot.&#8221; Jim pretended it was the rollcall
they demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; John Jacobs began seriously. But at
that moment Leigh Shirley, followed by Rosie Gimpke,
came from the side door with a tray of glasses and a
pitcher of lemonade.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, a toast to the man who stuck to the soil
and couldn&#8217;t be blasted to financial ruin by a boom, the
wheat king of these prairies. Our host, Asher Aydelot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The clod-hopper, Buckeye farmer,&#8221; Jim added affectionately,
and they drank to Asher&#8217;s health.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord bless you, Aydelot. You said the money was in
the soil, not on top of it. I remember you looked like a
prophet when you said it,&#8221; Cyrus Bennington declared.
&#8220;But I was wild to get rich quick and let my soil go.
I never look at Aydelot&#8217;s spreading acres of wheat increasing
in area every year without wondering why the Lord
let me be such a fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve spent a lot of days in an easy chair in
the shade of a county office since then while I was driving a
reaper in the hot sunshine,&#8221; Asher insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the strongest man here now, for all your farm
work, Aydelot,&#8221; John Jacobs asserted. &#8220;It is the store
that really breaks a man down.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not in his nerve, nor in pocketbook,&#8221; Todd Stewart
added. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a toast, now, to the second generation,
and especially to Thaine Aydelot, son of the Sunflower
Ranch. Nineteen years old tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What is Thaine going to follow, Asher?&#8221; someone
inquired. &#8220;I suppose you&#8217;ll be making a gentleman out
of him, since he&#8217;s your only child.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father tried to make a gentleman out of me and
failed, as you see,&#8221; Asher replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tragic failure,&#8221; Jim groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seriously, Aydelot, what&#8217;s Thaine to do?&#8221; The query
came from Dr. Carey; the company awaited the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t wanting to follow anything right now. He
has a notion that the earth is following him,&#8221; Asher said
with a smile. &#8220;And having handled Aydelots all my life,
I&#8217;m letting him alone a little with the hope that at last
he&#8217;ll come back to the soil as I did. He goes to the Kansas
University this fall and he has all sorts of notions, even a
craving for military glory. I can&#8217;t blame him. I had the
same disease once. I don&#8217;t believe in any wild oats business.
I hope Thaine will be a gentleman, but I don&#8217;t wonder
that a green country boy who has looked out all his life
on open prairies and lonely distances should have a longing
for city pavements and the busy haunts of men. How well
he will make his way and what he will let these things fit
him to do depends somewhat on how well grounded the
farm life and home life have made him. The old French
Aydelot blood had something of the wanderlust in it. I
hope that trait may not reappear in Thaine. But where&#8217;s
Pryor Gaines in this rollcall? We are getting away from
the subject before the house.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span></p>
<p>Jim Shirley&#8217;s handsome face grew sorrowful.</p>
<p>&#8220;He was not affected by the boom. He has been the
same man in spirit and fortune for twenty-five years. But
we are going to lose him. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s not here
tonight,&#8221; Jim hurried on as the others were about to interrupt
him. &#8220;He won&#8217;t say good-by to anybody. You can
understand why. He&#8217;s going to start for China tomorrow
morning&mdash;missionary! It&#8217;s the last of Pryor Gaines for
us. I promised not to tell till he was gone. I&#8217;ve lied to
him. That&#8217;s all. But you&#8217;ll not tell on me nor let him
know. He says he&#8217;s &#8217;called.&#8217; And when a preacher gets
that in his blood there&#8217;s no stopping him.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment Virginia Aydelot and a group of
matrons came thronging out.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in for the Virginia Reel,&#8221; they demanded. &#8220;The
young folks are having refreshments on the side porch
and Bo Peep wants us to dance for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;May I have the honor?&#8221; Horace Carey said, bowing
to Virginia Aydelot.</p>
<p>&#8220;With pleasure, Horace,&#8221; Virginia replied with a smile.</p>
<p>As they led the way to the dining room, Dr. Carey said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I congratulate you tonight, Virginia, on your son,
your kingly husband, and your busy, useful life. You&#8217;ve
won the West, you two.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; Virginia replied. &#8220;Not until our son proves
himself. He&#8217;s a farmer&#8217;s boy now. Wait five years till
he is the age his father was when he came out here. The
test of victory is the second generation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bo Peep&#8217;s fiddle began its song and the still young
middle-aged guests with their host and hostess kept time
to its rhythm.</p>

<p>The second generation gave little thought to what was
filling the minds of the first settlers tonight. The
company was a large one and a dozen years later more
than one young matron remembered Thaine Aydelot&#8217;s
birthday party as the beginning of a romance that ended
happily for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jo, you are the queen of the ball tonight,&#8221; Todd
Stewart, Junior, declared, as he led her to the cool veranda
after their fourth dance together.</p>
<p>Jo looked the part in the moonlight, as in the lamplight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, I&#8217;m not. Leigh Shirley is Thaine&#8217;s favorite,
and his choice is queen tonight,&#8221; Jo said coquettishly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Darn him! We all know who his choice is, all right,&#8221;
Todd said. &#8220;But, Jo, can&#8217;t a fellow have half a chance,
anyhow? You know, you can&#8217;t help knowing a lot of us
would fight for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He caught her hand in his and she did not resist at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jo, I know one fellow, anyhow&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at Thaine now,&#8221; Jo interrupted him, as Thaine
came near the open window. &#8220;Todd, do you know why
he thinks so much of Leigh Shirley?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of Leigh? Does he? I hope he does. He shows good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
taste, anyhow. Everybody from Little Plum Creek clear to
Northfork likes Leigh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jo&#8217;s eyes flashed.</p>
<p>&#8220;She must be very popular.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not as they like you, Jo. You must know the
difference between you two, a real beauty and a sweet little
girlie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not so sweet. She tries to attract and doesn&#8217;t
know how,&#8221; Jo declared, for jealousy belongs to the
dominant.</p>
<p>Todd Stewart&#8217;s sense of justice was strong, even in his
infatuation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Jo, you mustn&#8217;t be jealous of Leigh. She&#8217;s the
girl the boys can&#8217;t make like them. She&#8217;s the funniest,
settest little creature. And yet, she is a cute child. But
you are our pride, you know, and to me&mdash;well, let me
take you home tonight, and I&#8217;ll tell you about my pride.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care for your pride, if you all admire the cute
child.&#8221; Jo withdrew her hand from his. &#8220;Here comes
Thaine now. I think you&#8217;d better take Leigh home.
Thaine will take me, I&#8217;m sure. But I&#8217;ll go to refreshments
with you,&#8221; she added, for she knew how to play on more
than one string.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Josephine, my queen, my queen, where are you
hiding? I&#8217;ve danced an extra, waiting for you. Todd
Stewart, I&#8217;ll have to kill you yet tonight. What do you
mean by breaking up my party?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine caught Jo&#8217;s arm and with a mock thrust at
Todd he whirled her into the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you really miss me?&#8221; Jo&#8217;s big dark eyes were
fastened on Thaine&#8217;s face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
&#8220;More than tongue can tell. Who wouldn&#8217;t miss you?&#8221;
Thaine&#8217;s eyes were shining mischievously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leigh Shirley wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Jo said softly and half
sadly.</p>
<p>Something impenetrable dropped before Thaine&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go out to the honeysuckle arbor and not dance
now. I&#8217;m so tired,&#8221; Jo murmured, with a sweet pleading
in her voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;I fixed it just for you,&#8221; Thaine declared as he led the
way to the moonlit lawn and shadowy seat.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are so good to me, Thaine. What makes you do
so many things just for me? I know you don&#8217;t really
care for me. You are so different from most farmers&#8217;
sons.&#8221; Jo&#8217;s head drooped a little and she put one hand on
his arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t help being good to folks. It&#8217;s just the angel
in me,&#8221; Thaine declared. Then he added seriously, &#8220;I
wish I could do something for you, Jo. All the boys are
wild about you tonight. You are a picture.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was beautiful at the moment, and as she lifted her
eyes to his something in their shining depths spoke witchingly
to the youth of nineteen, untrained in ways of feminine
coquetry. He was only a country boy, unskilled in
social tactics, but a combination of timidity and good
breeding shaped his ideals and his action.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care for all the boys,&#8221; Jo murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we are hopelessly bankrupt,&#8221; Thaine declared.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t this a wonderful night?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and father and mother are going home so early,&#8221;
Jo said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, your whole wardrobe is over here; why not stay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
all night? You can help Rosie and mother and me tomorrow.
There are plenty of Benningtons left at your home
without you, and mother will want you,&#8221; Thaine urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want me to?&#8221; Jo asked softly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tremendously. We&#8217;ll eat all the ice cream that&#8217;s left
when the crowd goes and have the empty mansion all to
ourselves,&#8221; Thaine declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are to dance the last dance together too,&#8221; Jo
reminded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s run in now. The crowd doesn&#8217;t miss me, but I&#8217;m
host, you know, and they&#8217;re gasping for you. They&#8217;ll be
scouring the premises if we wait longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>As Thaine lifted Jo to her feet there was a glitter of
tears in her bright eyes. And because the place was
shadowy and sweet with honeysuckle perfume, and the
moonlight entrancing, and Jo was very willing, and tears
are ever appealing, he put his arm around her and drew
her close to him, and kissed her on each cheek.</p>
<p>Jo&#8217;s face was triumphant as they met Leigh Shirley at
the dining room door.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the next case on docket, Leigh?&#8221; Thaine
asked, dropping Jo&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>Jealousy has sharp eyes, but even jealousy could hardly
have found fault with the friendly and indifferent look on
Thaine&#8217;s face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s my first with you, Leigh. Who&#8217;s your partner,
Jo?&#8221; Thaine continued.</p>
<p>Two or three young men claimed the honor, and the
music began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mrs. Aydelot, Thaine has asked me to stay all night,&#8221;
Jo said, as the figures were forming.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It will please us all,&#8221; Virginia said graciously, and Jo
tripped away.</p>
<p>When the strains of music for the last dance began Jo
looked for Thaine, but he was nowhere to be found. She
waited impatiently and the angry glitter in her eyes was
not unbecoming her imperious air.</p>
<p>Bo Peep did not wait long, for he was getting tired.
Half a dozen young men rushed toward Jo as she stood
alone. But Todd Stewart let no opportunity escape him.
And the dance began. A minute later Thaine came in with
Leigh Shirley. Smiling a challenge at Todd, he caught
Leigh&#8217;s hand and swung into the crowd on the floor.</p>
<p>The older guests were already gone. The music trailed
off into a weird, rippling rhythm, with young hearts beating
time to its melody and young feet keeping step to its
measure. Then the tired, happy company broke into
groups. Good-bys and good wishes were given again and
again, and the party was over.</p>
<p>The couples took their way up or down the old Grass
River trail or out across the prairie by-roads, with the
moon sailing serenely down the west. Everybody voted
it the finest party ever given on Grass River. And nobody
at all, except his mother and Jo Bennington, noticed that
Thaine had not left Leigh Shirley&#8217;s side from his first
dance with her late in the evening until the time of the
good-bys.</p>
<p>As the guests were leaving Thaine turned to Jo,
saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry about that last dance, but I&#8217;ll forgive Todd
this last time. Rosie cut her hand on a glass tumbler she
dropped and I was helping Leigh to tie it up when old
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
Bo Peep started the music. Here&#8217;s the girl I&#8217;m to take
home. Got your draperies on already. The carriage waits
and the black steed paws for us by the chicken yard gate.
Good-night, gentle beings.&#8221; And taking Leigh&#8217;s arm, he
led her away.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gimpke is as awkward as a cow,&#8221; Jo Bennington declared,
&#8220;and too stupid to know what&#8217;s said to her.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Rosie Gimpke, standing in the shadows of the darkened
dining room, was not too stupid to understand what
was said about her. And into her stolid brain came dreams
that night of a fair face with soft golden brown hair and
kindly eyes of deep, tender blue. Stupid as she was, the
woman&#8217;s instinct in her told her in her dreams that the
handsome young son of her employer might not always look
his thoughts nor dance earliest and oftenest with the girl
he liked best. But Rosie was dull and slept heavily and
these things came to her sluggish brain only in fleeting
dreams.</p>
<p>Thaine and Leigh did not hurry on their homeward
way. And Jo Bennington, wide awake in the guest room
of the Aydelot house, noted that the moon was far toward
the west when Thaine let himself in at the side door and
slipped up stairs unheard by all the household except
herself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go down by the lake,&#8221; Thaine suggested as he
and Leigh came to the edge of the grove. &#8220;It&#8217;s full to
the bridge, and the lilies are wide open now. Are you
too sleepy to look at them? You used to draw them with
chalk all along the blackboard in the old schoolhouse up
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m never too sleepy to look at water lilies in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
moonlight,&#8221; Leigh replied, &#8220;nor too tired to paint them,
either. Lilies are a part of my creed. &#8216;Consider the
lilies, how they grow.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With their long rubbery stems, up out of mud mostly,&#8221;
Thaine said carelessly. &#8220;I pretty nearly grew fast along
with them down there, till I learned how to gather them
a better way.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woodland shadows were thrust through with shafts
of white moonbeams, giving a weird setting to the silent
midnight hour. The odor of woods&#8217; blossoms came with
the moist, fresh breath of the May night. There was a
little song of waters gurgling down the spillway that was
once only a dry draw choked with wild plum bushes. The
road wound picturesquely through the grove to a bridged
driveway that separated the lakelet into two parts. A
spread of silvery light lay on this driveway and Thaine
checked his horse in the midst of it while the two looked
at the waters.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all just silver or sable. There&#8217;s no middle tone,&#8221;
Leigh said, looking at the sparkling moonbeams reflected
on the face of the lake and the darkness of the shadowed
surface beyond them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t there pink, or creamy, or something softer in
those lilies right by the bank? I&#8217;m no artist, but that&#8217;s
how it looks to a clod-hopper,&#8221; Thaine declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are an artist, or you wouldn&#8217;t catch that, where
most anybody would see only steely white and dead black.
It is the only color in this black and white woodsy place,&#8221;
Leigh insisted, looking up at Thaine&#8217;s face in the shadow
and down at her own white dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a bit of color in your cheeks,&#8221; Thaine said,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
as he studied the girl&#8217;s fair countenance, all pink and white
in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not the pretty blooming roses like Jo Bennington
has,&#8221; Leigh said, smiling frankly and folding her hands
contentedly in her lap.</p>
<p>Thaine recalled the seat under the honeysuckle, and Jo
Bennington&#8217;s pleading eyes, and bewitching beauty, and
the touch of her hand on his arm, and her willingness to
be kissed. He was flattered by it all, for Jo was the belle
of the valley, and Thaine thought himself in love with her.
He knew that the other boys, especially Todd Stewart, Jr.,
envied him. And yet in this quiet hour in the silent grove,
with the waters shimmering below them, the gentle dignity
of the sweet-faced girl beside him, with her purity and
simplicity wrapping her about, as the morning mists
wrapped the far purple notches on the southwest horizon,
gave to her presence there an influence he could not
understand.</p>
<p>Thaine had never kissed any girl except Jo, had never
cared enough for any other girl to think about it. But
tonight there suddenly swept through his mind the thought
of the joy that was waiting for some man to whom Leigh
would give that privilege, and without any self-analysis
(boys at nineteen analyze little) he began to hate the man
who should come sometime to claim the privilege.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leigh, don&#8217;t you ever feel jealous of Jo?&#8221; He didn&#8217;t
know why he asked the question.</p>
<p>Leigh gave a little laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ought I?&#8221; she inquired, looking up. &#8220;She hasn&#8217;t
anything I want.&#8221;</p>
<p>The deep violet eyes under the long lashes were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
beautiful without the flashing and sparkle of Jo Bennington&#8217;s
coquettish gaze.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was an idiotic thing to ask,&#8221; Thaine admitted.
&#8220;Why should you, sure enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I had some of those lilies.&#8221; Leigh changed the
subject abruptly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hold the horse, then, and I&#8217;ll get them. I keep a
hooked knife on a long stick hidden down here on purpose
to cut them for me mummy, on occasion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine jumped out of the buggy and ran down to the
end of the driveway where the creamy lilies lay on the dark
waters near the bank.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful of your dress,&#8221; he said, as he came back
and handed a bunch of blossoms with their trailing wet
stems up to Leigh. &#8220;Do you remember your Prince
Quippi off in China, and your love letters, with old Grass
River for postal service? Will you send me a letter down
the old Kaw River when I go to the Kansas University
this fall?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A sunflower letter like I used to send to Quippi?&#8221;
Leigh asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any kind of a letter. I&#8217;ll miss you more than anything
here, except my beloved chores about the farm,&#8221;
Thaine responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jo will write all the letters you&#8217;ll have time to answer,&#8221;
Leigh asserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she says she&#8217;s going to Lawrence too, if her
pa-paw is elected County Treasurer. We&#8217;ll be in the
University together. You&#8217;ll just have to write to me,
Leighlie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless you go to China. I&#8217;ll send you a letter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
there like I used to send to Prince Quippi.&#8221; There was a
sudden pathos in her tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you? Oh, Leigh, will you?&#8221; Thaine asked, gaily,
looking down into her face, white and dainty in the soft
light. &#8220;Quippi never answered one of them, but I would
if I was over there, and I may go yet. There&#8217;s no telling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh looked up with her eyes full of pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I didn&#8217;t mean to tease you,&#8221; Thaine declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine, Pryor Gaines is to start to China tomorrow.
He&#8217;s been planning it for weeks and weeks. He&#8217;s going
to be a missionary and he&#8217;ll never come back again&mdash;and&mdash;and
there is so much for me to do when he is gone. He
has been such a kind helper all these years. His refined
taste has meant so much to me in the study of painting,
and I need him now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine gave a low whistle of surprise. Leigh&#8217;s eyes
were full of tears, but Thaine would not have dared to
take her in his arms, as he had taken Jo Bennington.</p>
<p>&#8220;Little neighbor, we&#8217;ve been playmates nearly all our
lives. Can&#8217;t I help you in some way?&#8221; he asked gently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you can,&#8221; Leigh replied in a low voice. &#8220;There
are some things I must do for Uncle Jim and when you
are doing <i>for</i> people you can&#8217;t tell them nor depend on
their advice. When Pryor is gone, may I ask you sometimes
what to do? I won&#8217;t bother you often.&#8221;</p>
<p>Asher Aydelot had declared that Alice Leigh was the
prettiest girl in Ohio in her day.</p>
<p>The pink-tinted creamy lilies looking up from the still
surface of the lakelet were not so fair as the pink-tinted
face of Alice Leigh&#8217;s daughter, framed in the soft brown
shadows of her hair with a hint of gold in the ripples at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
the white temples. And behind the face, looking out
through long-lashed violet eyes, was loving sacrifice and
utter self-forgetfulness.</p>
<p>Thaine was nineteen and wise to give advice. A sudden
thrill caught his pulse, mid-beat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that all? Can&#8217;t I <i>do</i> something?&#8221; he asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a great deal. And nobody can <i>do</i> for anybody.
We have to <i>do</i> for ourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not doing anything for Uncle Jim, then, I
am to understand,&#8221; Thaine said.</p>
<p>But Leigh ignored his thrust, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;When Pryor leaves, he doesn&#8217;t want to say good-by
to anybody, not even to Uncle Jim. He says China is
only a little way off, just behind the purple notches over
there. I&#8217;m going to take him to the train tomorrow and
then I&#8217;m going on to Wykerton on business. After that, I
may need lots of advice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wykerton&#8217;s a joint-ridden place, but John Jacobs has
put a good class of farmers around it. He&#8217;s such an old
saloon hater, Hans Wyker&#8217;d like to kill him. But say,
why not tell me now what you are about, so I can be looking
up references and former judicial decisions handed
down in similar cases?&#8221; Thaine asked lightly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s too long a story, and I must get Pryor
to the eight o&#8217;clock limited,&#8221; Leigh said.</p>
<p>The crowing of chickens in a far away farmyard came
faintly at that moment, and Thaine with a strange new
sense of the importance of living, sent the black horses
cantering down the trail to the old Cloverdale Ranch house.</p>
<p>Jo Bennington slept late. She had been up late. She
had danced often and she had waited for Thaine&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
homecoming. Yet, when she came downstairs in a white morning
dress all sprinkled with little pink sprays, there was
hardly a hint of weariness in her young face or in her quick
footsteps.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you stayed, Jo,&#8221; Mrs. Aydelot greeted her.
&#8220;This is &#8217;the morning after the night before,&#8217; and, as
usual, the desertions equal the wounded and imprisoned.
Asher and the men had to go across the river early to look
after the fences and washouts on the lower quarter. And
Rosie Gimpke decided to go home this morning as soon
as breakfast was done. So it is left for us to get the house
over the party. Not so easy as getting ready for it,
especially without help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s Thaine?&#8221; Jo asked carelessly, though her
face was a tattler.</p>
<p>&#8220;He took some colts over to John Jacobs&#8217; ranch. He
had Rosie ride one and he rode another and led two. They
were a sight. I hoped you might see them go by your
window. Thaine had his hat stuck on like a Dutchman&#8217;s
and he puffed himself out and made up a regular Wyker
face as he jogged along. And Rosie plumped herself
down on that capering colt as though she shifted all responsibility
for accidents upon it. The more it pranced
about, the firmer she sat and the less concerned she was.
I heard Thaine calling out, &#8216;Breakers ahead!&#8217; as he
watched her bring it back into the road in front of him
with a sort of side kick of her foot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What made Gimpke leave?&#8221; Jo asked, to cover her
disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;She cut her hand badly last night. She insisted at
first that she would help me today and go home later to stay
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
till it gets well. Then she suddenly changed her mind.
Possibly it was the spare-room bed,&#8221; Virginia said laughing.
&#8220;When I told her not to wake you when she made
up the other beds, she suddenly got homesick, her hand
grew worse and she flew the premises. I&#8217;ll run up and
attend to that bed while you finish your breakfast,&#8221; and
Virginia left the room.</p>
<p>At that moment young Todd Stewart appeared on the
side porch before the dining room door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine stopped long enough to ask me to come over
and move furniture for his mother,&#8221; Todd sang out. &#8220;He
doesn&#8217;t think you were made to lift cupboards and carry
chairs downstairs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s his mother he&#8217;s thinking about,&#8221; Jo said with
pretty petulance. In truth, she was angry with Thaine
for taking Leigh home last night and for leaving home
today.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s his mother he&#8217;s ceased to love,&#8221; Todd said,
coming inside. &#8220;He said he&#8217;d quit the old home and was
moving his goods up to Wolf Creek for keeps. And with
that fat tow-headed Gimpke girl sitting on the frisky bay
colt as unconcerned as a bump on a log, it was the funniest
sight I ever saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jo tossed her head contemptuously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Curly Locks, Curly Locks, you ought to always
sit on a cushion and sew a fine seam and wear a dress to
breakfast with those little pink du-dads scattered over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if I was a farmer&#8217;s wife,&#8221; Jo responded quickly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jo, do you really want to be a city girl?&#8221; Todd&#8217;s
face was frankly sorrowful. &#8220;Could you never be satisfied
on a farm?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I ever could,&#8221; Jo said prettily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine&#8217;s a farmer all right, Jo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He isn&#8217;t going to be one always,&#8221; Jo broke in quickly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s going to the Kansas University and there&#8217;s no
telling after that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;s just going to Wykerton, that&#8217;s all. Nay, he
have went. Him and him fraulein. And say, there&#8217;s
another pretty fraulein went up the trail just ahead of the
Aydelot horse party. A sweetheart of a girl whom Thaine
Aydelot took home after all last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care where Thaine goes,&#8221; Jo cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you don&#8217;t care for a farmer anyhow,&#8221; Todd said
suavely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that depends on how helpful he is,&#8221; Jo responded
tactfully.</p>
<p>Todd sprang up and began to fling the chairs about with
extravagant energy in his pretense of being useful.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s help Mrs. Aydelot as swift as possible. It&#8217;s hot
as the dickens this morning, and the prognostics are for a
cyclone before twelve hours. It&#8217;s nearly eleven of &#8217;em now.
I&#8217;ll take you home when we are through. Thaine isn&#8217;t the
whole of Grass River and the adjacent creeks and tributaries
and all that in them is.&#8221;</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Meanwhile the May sunshine beat hot upon the
green prairie, and the promised storm gathered itself
together behind the horizon where the three headlands were
lost in an ash-colored blur. Wykerton, shut in by the
broken country about Big Wolf Creek, was more uncomfortable
than the open prairie. And especially was it
uncomfortable in the &#8220;blind tiger&#8221; of the Wyker eating-house.</p>
<p>Today the men of the old firm of Champers &amp; Co. were
again holding a meeting in this little room that could have
told of much lawless plotting if walls could only tell.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s danged hot in here, Wyker. Open that window,&#8221;
Darley Champers complained. &#8220;What kept you fellows so
long, anyhow?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Business kep&#8217; me, and Smith here, he stop to peek at
a pretty girl for goot as ten minute,&#8221; Hans Wyker said
jocosely.</p>
<p>Champers stared at Thomas Smith, whose small eyes
gleamed back at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I just turned to look at Miss Shirley in the dining
room. Can&#8217;t a man look at a pretty girl if he is past
forty-five? She didn&#8217;t see me, though.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Naw, she see nopotty but young Aydelot sitting mit
her. Why you take oop precious time peekin&#8217; trough der
crack in der kitchen door? I be back in a minute vonce.
Smitt haf business mit you,&#8221; Wyker declared as he turned
to the kitchen again.</p>
<p>Left together, the two men sat silent a moment. Then
Champers said with a frown:</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you want now? We&#8217;ve got no business with
each other except as I am agent for your rents and
mortgages.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to fatten on them, or something,&#8221; Smith
answered insinuatingly. &#8220;You lose no flesh with the years,
I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve little occasion to worry,&#8221; Darley Champers replied
meaningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not with a fat income like yours and small returns to
your employer who&#8217;s kept you all these years,&#8221; Smith
began, but Darley Champers mentally blew up. It was in
the bluffer&#8217;s game that he always succeeded best.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, see here, dang you. Get to business. You and
Wyker and me dissolved partnership long ago. I&#8217;ve been
your agent years and years. I&#8217;ve did my best. I never
got so rich you could notice it on my breath. I&#8217;m not a
thief nor a murderer. I keep inside the law. I broke with
you fellows years ago, except straight contract that&#8217;ll
probate in any court. You are a bully in power and a
coward out of it. What the devil do you want with me?
I&#8217;m no bank. Be clear and quick about it and quit your
infernal dodgin&#8217; human beins like a cut-throat. I&#8217;ve
signed your name to no end of papers for you when you
wouldn&#8217;t put your own left-handed writin&#8217; in sight. I have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
your written permit safe for doin&#8217; it. I reckon somebody
must a&#8217; put that right hand of yours out of commission
sometime. I&#8217;ll find out about it one of these days myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thomas Smith sat looking at the speaker with steady
gaze. Many lines crossed his countenance now, but the
crooked scar had not faded with time. In a coffin his would
be the face of an old man. Alive, it was so colorless and
uninteresting in expression that not one person in a hundred
would turn to take a second look at him nor dream of
the orgies of dissipation his years could recount. Withal,
he had the shabby, run-down appearance as of a man in
hard lines financially.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want money and I want it quick, or I&#8217;d not come clear
out here. And you are going to get it for me. That
Cloverdale quarter I&#8217;ve held grown to weeds so long you
will sell to the first buyer now. Jim Shirley&#8217;s at the last
of his string. I did what I wanted to do with him. He&#8217;ll
never own a quarter again,&#8221; Smith spoke composedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess you&#8217;re right. You&#8217;ve done him to his ruin.
Jacobs has a mortgage on his home, too, and a Jew&#8217;s a
Jew. He&#8217;ll close on Jim with a snap yet. It won&#8217;t be
the first time he&#8217;s done it,&#8221; Darley Champers declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;And that niece, Tank&#8217;s girl, he was to protect for
Alice Leigh?&#8221; Smith asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, eventually she&#8217;ll either marry some hired man, I
reckon, or go to sewin&#8217; or something like it for a livin&#8217;.
She&#8217;s a danged pretty girl now, but girls fade quick,&#8221;
Champers said.</p>
<p>For just one instant something like remorse swept
Smith&#8217;s face. Then he hardened again as the ruling passion
asserted itself.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Serves her right,&#8221; he said in a tone so brutal that
Champers remembered it.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I tell you I must have money. Two hundred dollars
tonight and fourteen hundred inside of two weeks.
And you&#8217;ll get it for me. You understand that. And
listen, now.&#8221; Smith&#8217;s voice slowly uncoiled itself to
Champers&#8217; senses as a snake moves leisurely toward a bird it
means to draw to itself. &#8220;You say you have signed my
name for me and transacted business, handling my money.
If you care to air the thing in court, I&#8217;m ready for you
anytime. But do you dare? Well, bring me two hundred
dollars before tomorrow and the other fourteen hundred
inside of two weeks. And after this look out for yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>The threat in the last words was indescribable, and
Champers would have shuddered could he have seen Smith&#8217;s
countenance as he left the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;So he taunts me with being a coward and a brute, a
thief and a cut-throat; dares to strike me in the face when
I&#8217;ve given him a living so long he&#8217;s forgotten who did it.
I&#8217;m done with him. But he don&#8217;t dare to say a word.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shut his lips tightly and slowly clinched his hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;For wy you stare so at dat door yet? Where&#8217;s Champers?&#8221;
Hans Wyker demanded as he came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;The game&#8217;s between us two now,&#8221; Thomas Smith declared,
turning to Hans Wyker.</p>
<p>And a grim game was plotted then and there. Hans,
who had been a perpetual law-breaker since the loss of his
brewery business, had let his hatred of John Jacobs grow
to a virulent poison in his system. While Thomas Smith,
whose character Darley Champers had read truly, followed
so many wrong paths down the years that conscience and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
manhood were strangers to him. From being a financier
he had dropped to the employment of a brewers&#8217; association.
His commission was to tempt young men and boys to
drink; to create appetites that should build up the brewing
business for the future. In the game now, Smith was to
deliver beer and whisky into Wyker&#8217;s hands. Wyker would
do the rest. Whoever opposed him must suffer for his
rashness.</p>
<p>It was cooler in the large dining-room where Thaine
Aydelot and Leigh Shirley had met by chance at noontime.
Leigh&#8217;s face wore a deeper bloom and her eyes were shining
with the exciting events of the day: the going of Pryor
Gaines and the business that had brought her to Wykerton.
Something like pain stabbed suddenly into Thaine Aydelot&#8217;s
mind as he caught sight of her, a surprise to find how
daintily attractive she was in her cool summer gown of
pale blue gingham and her becoming hat with its broad
brim above her brown-gold hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t expect to find you here,&#8221; Leigh said as Thaine
took the chair opposite her at the little table.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came over to Little Wolf with Rosie Gimpke and
some other colts. Then I walked over here to catch a ride
to Careyville, if I could,&#8221; Thaine said carelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can ride with me if you want to. I&#8217;ll be going
soon after dinner,&#8221; Leigh suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll want to all right. It may be well to start
early. It&#8217;s so hot I expect there&#8217;ll be a storm before
night,&#8221; Thaine suggested, wondering the while what
Leigh&#8217;s business in Wykerton might be.</p>
<p>Darley Champers was in a fever when he came from his
conference with Thomas Smith. Smith had played large
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
sums into his hands in the first years of their partnership.
Of late the sums had all gone the other way. But Champers
was entangled enough to know that he must raise the
money required, and the land was the only asset. Few
things are more difficult to accomplish than to find a buyer
for what must be sold.</p>
<p>At the office Leigh was waiting for him. &#8220;Mr. Champers,
I am Leigh Shirley from the Cloverdale place on
Grass River,&#8221; she said, looking earnestly up at him.</p>
<p>Darley Champers was no ladies&#8217; man, but so far as in
his coarse-grained nature lay, he was never knowingly rude
to a woman, and Leigh&#8217;s manner and presence made the
atmosphere of his office comfortingly different from the
place he had just quitted. The white lilac bush in the
yard behind the office whose blossoms sent a faint odor
through the rear door, seemed to double its fragrance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, madam. I&#8217;m pleased to meet you. Can I
be of any service to you today?&#8221; he said with bluff
cordiality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir. I want to buy the quarter section lying southeast
of us. It was the old Cloverdale Ranch once. It
belongs to Champers &amp; Co. now, the records show, and I
want to get it. It was my Uncle Jim Shirley&#8217;s first claim.&#8221;</p>
<p>Darley Champers stared at the girl and said nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you ask for it?&#8221; Leigh inquired.</p>
<p>Still the real estate dealer was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it for sale? It is all weed-grown and hasn&#8217;t been
cultivated for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>The tremor in the girl&#8217;s voice reached the best spot in
Darley Champers&#8217; trade-hardened heart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, yes, it&#8217;s for sale!&#8221; he broke out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span></p>
<p>A sense of relief at this sudden opportunity, combined
with the intense satisfaction of getting even with Thomas
Smith, overwhelmed him. Smith would rave at the sale to
a Shirley, yet this sale had been demanded. Champers had
written Smith&#8217;s name into too many documents to need the
owner&#8217;s handwriting in this transaction. Smith would leave
town in the evening. The whole thing was easy enough.
While Leigh waited, the real humaneness of which Champers
so often boasted found its voice within him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll sell it for sixteen hundred dollars if I can get two
hundred down today and the rest in cash inside of two
weeks. But I must close the bargain today, you understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had fully meant to make it seventeen hundred fifty
dollars. It was the unknown humane thing in him that
cut off his own commission.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s worth it,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;Won&#8217;t Thomas
Smith, who&#8217;s got no name to sign to a piece of paper,
won&#8217;t he just cuss when it&#8217;s all did! It&#8217;s worth my little
loss just to get something dead on him. The tricky
thief!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it,&#8221; Leigh said, a strange light glowing in
her eyes and a firm line settling about her red lips.</p>
<p>Champers couldn&#8217;t realize an hour later how it was all
done, nor why with such a poor bargain for himself he
should feel such satisfaction as he saw Leigh Shirley and
Thaine Aydelot driving down the road toward Little Wolf
together. Neither could he understand why the perfume of
white lilac blossoms from the bush in the back yard of his
office should seem so sweet this morning. He was not a
flower lover. But he felt the two hundred dollars of good
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
money in his pocket and chuckled as he forecasted the
hour of Thomas Smith&#8217;s discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a shadier road than the one I came over this
morning,&#8221; Leigh said as she and Thaine followed the old
trail toward Little Wolf Creek.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little nearer, too, and you&#8217;ll see by casting a
glimpse westward that things are doing over Grass River
way,&#8221; Thaine replied.</p>
<p>Leigh saw that a sullen black cloud bank was heaving
above the western horizon and felt the heated air of the
May afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like storms when I&#8217;m away from home,&#8221; she
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you afraid, like Jo Bennington? She has the
terrors over them. We were out once when she nearly
bankrupted everything, she was so scared.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine recalled a stormy night when Jo had clung to
his arm to the danger of both of them and the frightened
horse he could hardly control.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not afraid. I just don&#8217;t like being blown
about. I am glad I happened to find you, to be blown
about, too, if it&#8217;s necessary,&#8221; Leigh replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Happened&#8217; is a good word, Leigh. You happened
on what I managed you should, else that long circus performance
with Mademoiselle Rosella Gimpkello, famous
bareback rider, had not been put on the sawdust this hot
day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you saying, Thaine Aydelot?&#8221; Leigh asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said last night you were coming over here today
and that after you had come you might need my advice.
Me for the place where my advice is needed ever, on land
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
or water. Rosie&#8217;s hand isn&#8217;t fit to use yet. I knew that
was a nasty glass cut, so I met her in the hall upstairs early
this morning and persuaded her to come over today. It
gave me the excuse I wanted&mdash;to get here by mere happening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And leave Mrs. Aydelot all the cleaning up to do.
Humane son!&#8221; Leigh exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Jo stayed all night, and I stopped at Todd Stewart&#8217;s
place and persuaded him down to help mother and
Jo. It wasn&#8217;t hard work to get him persuaded, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you jealous of Todd?&#8221; Leigh asked, with a
demure curve of her lip.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ought I be? He hasn&#8217;t anything I want,&#8221; Thaine
retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;s a farmer. Some folks don&#8217;t like farmers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame them,&#8221; Thaine said thoughtlessly. &#8220;I
haven&#8217;t much use for a farm myself. But Leigh, am I an
unnecessary evil? I really turned &#8217;Rory Rumpus&#8217; and
&#8217;rode a raw-boned racer&#8217; clear over here just to be ready
to help you. I wish now I&#8217;d stayed home and dried the
knives and forks and spoons for my mammie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Thaine, you are as good as&mdash;as alfalfa hay, and
I need you more today than I ever did in my life before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I want to help you more than anything. Don&#8217;t
be a still cat, Leighlie. Tell me what you are up to.&#8221;</p>
<p>They had reached the steep hill beyond the Jacobs sheep
range where the narrow road with what John Jacobs called
&#8220;the scary little twist&#8221; wound down between high banks
to a shadowy hollow leading out to the open trail by the
willows along Big Wolf. At the break in the bank, opening
a rough way down to the deep waters of Little Wolf, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
draught of cool air swept up refreshingly against their
faces. Thaine flattened the buggy top under the shade
of overhanging trees and held the horse to the spot to
enjoy the delightful coolness. They had no such eerie
picture to prejudice them against the place as the picture
that haunted John Jacobs&#8217; mind here.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve bought a ranch, Thaine; the quarter section that
Uncle Jim entered in 1870,&#8221; Leigh said calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alice Leigh Shirley, are you crazy?&#8221; Thaine exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m safe and sane. But that&#8217;s why I need your
advice,&#8221; Leigh answered.</p>
<p>Something in the girl&#8217;s appealing voice and perfect confidence
of friendship, so unlike Jo Bennington&#8217;s pouting
demands and pretty coquetry, came as a revelation and a
sense of loss to Thaine. For he loved Jo. He was sure of
that, cock-sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this way,&#8221; Leigh went on, &#8220;you know how Uncle
Jim lost everything in the boom except his honor. He&#8217;s
helped everybody who needed help, and everybody likes
him, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew anybody who didn&#8217;t,&#8221; Thaine agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;So many things, I needn&#8217;t name them all, bad crops,
bad faith on the part of others, bad luck and bad judgment
and bad health, for all his size, have helped till he
is ready to go hopeless, and Uncle Jim&#8217;s only fifty-one.
It&#8217;s no time to quit till you&#8217;re eighty in such a good old
state as Kansas,&#8221; Leigh asserted. &#8220;Only, big as he is, he&#8217;s
not a real strong man, and crumples down where small
nervy men stand up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, lady landlord, how can I advise you? You are
past advising. You have already bought,&#8221; Thaine said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can tell me how to pay for the ranch,&#8221; Leigh
declared calmly. &#8220;I bought of Darley Champers for sixteen
hundred dollars. I paid two hundred down just now.
I&#8217;ve been saving it two years; since I left the high school at
Careyville. Butter and eggs and chickens and some other
things.&#8221; She hesitated, and a dainty pink tint swept her
cheek.</p>
<p>Why should a girl be so deliciously fair with the bloom
of summer on her cheeks and with little ringlets curling
in baby-gold hair about her temples and at her neck, and
with such red lips sweet to kiss, and then put about herself
a faint invisible something that should make the young man
beside her blush that he would even think of being so rude
as to try to kiss her.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you paid how much?&#8221; Thaine asked gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two hundred dollars. I want to borrow fourteen hundred
more and get it clear away from Darley Champers.
I&#8217;m sure with a ranch again, Uncle Jim will be able to win
out,&#8221; Leigh insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s on it now?&#8221; Thaine asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just weeds and a million sunflowers. Enough to send
Prince Quippi such a message he&#8217;d have to write back a
real love letter to me,&#8221; Leigh replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leighlie, you can&#8217;t do it. You might pay interest
maybe, year in and year out, the gnawing, wearing interest.
That&#8217;s all you&#8217;d do even with your hens and butter.
Don&#8217;t undertake the burden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already done it,&#8221; Leigh declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw it up. You can&#8217;t make it,&#8221; Thaine urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know I can,&#8221; Leigh maintained stoutly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How?&#8221; Thaine queried hopelessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can get the loan&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Which you can&#8217;t,&#8221; Thaine broke in. &#8220;Any man on
Grass River will tell you the same, if you don&#8217;t want to
believe the word of a nineteen-year-old boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine, I must do something. Even our home is
mortgaged. Everything is slipping out from under us.
You don&#8217;t know what that means.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My father and mother knew it over and over.&#8221; Thaine&#8217;s
face was full of sympathy.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they won out. I&#8217;m not so foolish after all. When
they came out here, they took the prairies as Nature had
left them, grass-covered and waiting. I&#8217;m taking them as
the boom left them, weed-covered and waiting. I&#8217;ll earn
the interest myself and make the land pay the principal
and I know exactly how it will do it, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me how,&#8221; Thaine demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no dream. I got the idea out of a Coburn book last
winter,&#8221; Leigh replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean the State Agricultural Report of Secretary
Coburn? Funny place to hunt for inspiration; queer gospel,
I&#8217;d say,&#8221; Thaine declared. &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you go to
the census report of 1890, or Radway&#8217;s Ready Relief
Almanac, or the Unabridged Dictionary?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, you despiser of small things. It was just an
agricultural report full of tables and statistics and comparative
values and things that I happened on one day
when things were looking blackest, and right in the middle
I found a page that Foster Dwight Coburn must have put
in just for me, I guess. There was a little sketch of an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
alfalfa plant with its long good roots, and just one paragraph
beside it with the title, &#8216;The Silent Subsoiler.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds well,&#8221; Thaine observed. He was listening
eagerly in spite of his joking, and his mind was alert to the
girl&#8217;s project.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Coburn said,&#8221; Leigh went on, &#8220;that there are
some silent subsoilers that do their work with ease and as
effectually as any plow ever hitched, and the great one of
these is alfalfa; that it is a reservoir of wealth that takes
away the fear of protest and over-draft.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, and what if Coburn is right?&#8221; Thaine queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen, now. I planned how I&#8217;d get back that old claim
of Uncle Jim&#8217;s; how I&#8217;d pay some money down and borrow
the rest, and begin seeding it to alfalfa. Then I&#8217;ll churn
and feed chickens and make little sketches of water lilies,
maybe, and pay the interest and let the alfalfa pay off
the principal. I haven&#8217;t any father or mother, Thaine;
Uncle Jim is all I have. He hasn&#8217;t always been successful
in business ventures, but he&#8217;s always been honest. He has
nothing to blush for, nothing to keep hidden. I know
we&#8217;ll win now, for that writing of Foster Dwight Coburn&#8217;s
is true. Don&#8217;t try to discourage me, Thaine,&#8221; she looked
up with shining eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a silent little subsoiler yourself, Leigh, doing
your work effectually. Of course you&#8217;ll win, you brave
girl. I wish it was a different kind of work, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>A low peal of thunder rolled up from the darkening
horizon, and the sun disappeared behind the advancing
clouds.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s our notice to quit the premises. I shouldn&#8217;t
want to ford Little Wolf in a storm. It is ugly enough
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
any time and was bank full when I took Rosie Posie over
this morning. And say, her mother&#8217;s got a face like a
brass bedstead.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine was lifting the buggy top as he spoke. Suddenly
he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Leigh, look down yonder.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed down the little rift toward the water.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; Leigh asked, looking in the direction of his
hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Across the creek, around by the side of that hill.
That&#8217;s the Gimpke home stuck in there where you&#8217;d never
think of looking for a house from up here. They can see
anybody that goes up this lonely hill and nobody can
see them. If I was gunning for Gimpkes, I&#8217;d lie in wait
right here,&#8221; Thaine declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe, if the Gimpkes were gunning for you, they
could pick you off as you went innocently up this Kyber
Pass and you&#8217;d never know what hit you nor live to tell
the tale; and they so snugly out of sight nobody but
you would ever have sighted them,&#8221; Leigh replied. &#8220;But
let&#8217;s hurry on. It will be cooler on the open prairie than
down there along the creek trail. And if we are storm-stayed,
we are storm-stayed, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are the comfortablest girl a fellow could have,
Leighlie. You aren&#8217;t a bit scared of storms like&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, like Jo. I can&#8217;t help it. I never was much of a
&#8217;fraid cat, but I don&#8217;t mind admitting I am fonder of
water in lakes and rivers and water-color drawings than
thumping down on my head from the little end of a cyclone
funnel.&#8221;</p>
<p>The air grew cooler in their homeward ride, while they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
followed the same old Sunflower Trail that Asher and Virginia
Aydelot had followed one September day a quarter of
a century before. And, for some reason, they did not stop
to question, neither was eager to reach the end of the trail
today.</p>
<p>As they came to a crest of the prairie looking down a
long verdant slope toward what was now a woodsy draw,
Thaine said, &#8220;Leigh, my mother was lost here somewhere
once and Doctor Carey found her. Maybe Doctor Carey
is the man to help you now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Thaine, I believe I could ask Doctor Carey for
anything. You are so good to think of him,&#8221; Leigh
exclaimed. &#8220;I knew you&#8217;d help me out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m good. That&#8217;s my trade,&#8221; Thaine replied.
&#8220;And I&#8217;m pretty brave to offer advice, too. But if you
want to talk any about courage, mine&#8217;s a different brand
from yours. I may be a soldier myself some day. Brother
Aydelot of the Sunflower Ranch, trustee of the Grass River
M. E. Church, fit, bled, and died in the Civil War and
was not quite my age now when he came out all battle-scoured
and gory. I always said I&#8217;d be a soldier like my
popper. But I&#8217;d fall in a dead faint before that alfalfa
and mortgage business you face like a hero. It&#8217;s getting
cooler. See, the storm didn&#8217;t get this side of the purple
notches; it stayed over there with Pryor Gaines and Prince
Quippi.&#8221;</p>
<p>They rode awhile in silence, then Thaine said: &#8220;Leigh,
I will go up to Careyville and send Doctor Carey down to
Cloverdale to see you. It will save you some time at least,
and I&#8217;ll tell him you want to see him particularly and alone.
You can tell me the result Sunday if you want to.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>Leigh did not reply, but gratitude in the violet eyes
made words unnecessary.</p>
<p>On the Sabbath after the party, Thaine Aydelot waited
at the church door for Jo Bennington, who loitered out
slowly, chatting the while with Todd Stewart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me take you home, Jo. I see your carriage will
be full with the company you will have today,&#8221; Thaine
said.</p>
<p>Jo looked with a pretty pout at the invited guests gathered
about her mother and father waiting for her at the
family carriage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, yes. I am glad to get away from those
tiresome goody-goodies. It looks like the Benningtons are
taking the whole official board and the &#8217;amen corner&#8217; home
for dinner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then come to the Sunflower Inn and dine with me.
Rosie Gimpke came back last night and she promised me
shortcake and sauerkraut and pretzels and schooners of
Grass River water. Do come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed, Thaine had been most uncomfortable since the
day at Wykerton, and he wanted to be especially good to
Jo now. He didn&#8217;t know exactly why, nor had he felt any
jealousy at the bright looks and the leisure preference she
had just given to Todd Stewart.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you are too good. Yes, I&#8217;ll go, of course,&#8221; Jo
exclaimed. &#8220;Can&#8217;t we go down to the grove and see the
lilies this afternoon, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we can go to China if we want to,&#8221; Thaine declared.
&#8220;Wait here in the shade until I drive up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Teams were being backed away from the hitching-rack,
and much chatting of neighbors was everywhere. Jim
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
Shirley was not at church today, and Jo saw Leigh Shirley
going alone toward the farther end of the rack where her
buggy stood, while three or four young men were rushing
to untie her horse. Jo, turning to speak to some neighbors,
did not notice who had outdistanced the others in this
country church courtesy until she realized that the crowd
was going, and down the deserted hitching line Leigh Shirley
sat in her buggy talking with Thaine, who was standing
beside it with his foot on the step, looking up earnestly
into her face.</p>
<p>Jo was no better pleased that Leigh&#8217;s face was like a fair
picture under her white hat, and she felt her own cheeks
flushing as she saw how cool and poised and unhurried her
little neighbor appeared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Thaine. All right. Don&#8217;t forget, then,&#8221;
Jo heard her say as she gathered up the reins, and noted
that it was her motion and not the young man&#8217;s that cut
short the interview.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leigh is a leech when she has the chance,&#8221; Jo said
jokingly, as the two sat in the Aydelot buggy at last.</p>
<p>When one has grown up from babyhood the ruling spirit
in a neighborhood, her opinions are to be accepted.</p>
<p>Thaine gave Jo a quick look but said nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, papa says Jim isn&#8217;t very well this summer.
Says he still grieves over the farm he lost. Leigh
hasn&#8217;t much ahead of her, nailed down to a chicken lot
and a cow pasture and a garden. I wonder they don&#8217;t move
to town. She&#8217;d get a clerkship, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine only waited, and Jo ran on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d never stay in the country a minute if I could get
to town. I&#8217;ll be glad when papa&#8217;s elected treasurer, so we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
can live in Careyville again. Poor Leigh. Doesn&#8217;t she
look like a drudge?&#8221;</p>
<p>Still Thaine was silent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you say something?&#8221; Jo demanded, looking
coquettishly at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221; he asked gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;About Leigh. I don&#8217;t want to do all the gossiping.
Tell me what you think of her.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would take a Cyclopedia Britannica set of volumes
to do that,&#8221; Thaine replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, be serious and answer my questions,&#8221; Jo demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Doesn&#8217;t she look like a drudge?&#8217; What kind of an
answer&mdash;information or just my opinion?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, your opinion, of course,&#8221; Jo said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If she looks like a drudge, it&#8217;s what she is.&#8221; The
young man&#8217;s eyes were on his team.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you liked her,&#8221; Jo insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; Thaine replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much, pray?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t measured yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine Aydelot was by inheritance a handsome young
fellow, and as he turned now to his companion, something
in his countenance gave it a manliness not usual to his
happy-go-lucky expression. But the same unpenetrable
something beyond which no one could see was always on
his face when Jo talked of Leigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;How much do you like me?&#8221; The query was daringly
put, but the beauty of the girl&#8217;s striking face seemed to
warrant anything from her lips, however daring.</p>
<p>&#8220;A tremendous lot, I know that,&#8221; Thaine replied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
quickly, and Jo dropped her eyes and began to chatter of
other things.</p>
<p>In the afternoon the cool grove was inviting, and Thaine
and Jo loitered about in careless enjoyment of woodland
shadows and wind-dimpled waters and Sabbath quiet and
one another.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want father to have a little boathouse over by the lily
corner and make a picnic place here sometime,&#8221; Thaine
said as they sat by the lake in the late afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a nice place for you to come in the summer.
Aren&#8217;t you glad you don&#8217;t just have to stay in the
country?&#8221; Jo asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you never be satisfied in the country, Jo?&#8221;
Thaine queried. &#8220;Not if you had a home there?&#8221;</p>
<p>Jo blushed and her face was exquisite in its rich coloring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Would you be?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d like to do something worth while,&#8221; Thaine
replied. &#8220;Father doesn&#8217;t say much, but he wants me
here, I know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He will get over it, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; Jo insisted. &#8220;Why
should the first generation here weight us all down here,
too? I hope you&#8217;ll not give up to your father. I
wouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; Jo said defiantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever give up to him?&#8221; Thaine asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he gives up to me.&#8221; The words were too sweetly
said to seem harsh.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t blame him,&#8221; Thaine added.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe any of our crowd will stay here like
the old folks have done, except Todd Stewart and, of
course, Leigh,&#8221; Jo declared.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Jo, my folks don&#8217;t look old to me. Mummie is
younger and good-lookinger than anybody, except&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leigh Shirley,&#8221; Jo broke in.</p>
<p>Thaine looked at his watch without replying.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it late? You must take me home, now,&#8221; Jo said.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll be over tonight, won&#8217;t you? We will have some
company from Careyville who want to meet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I promised Leigh up here at church that
I&#8217;d go over to Cloverdale for a little while tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine could not tell Jo of Leigh&#8217;s affairs, and he felt
that the Shirleys&#8217; intimacy with his father&#8217;s family and his
own expressed admiration and attention to Jo were sufficient
to protect him from jealousy. Jo stiffened visibly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine Aydelot, what&#8217;s the reason for your actions&mdash;Oh,
I don&#8217;t care. Go to Shirley&#8217;s, by all means. Everybody
to his likes,&#8221; she cried angrily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s my rathers for tonight, and I can&#8217;t help
it,&#8221; Thaine answered hotly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you can&#8217;t. Let&#8217;s go home quick so you can
get off early,&#8221; Jo said in an angered tone.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go as slowly as I can. You can&#8217;t get rid of me
so.&#8221; Thaine was getting control of himself again.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Thaine, tell me why you go away from our company
tonight,&#8221; Jo pleaded softly, putting her hand on her
companion&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you care to come to our house
any more?&#8221;</p>
<p>They were in the buggy now on the driveway across the
lake. Thaine recalled the moonlight hour when he sat with
Leigh, of how little Leigh seemed to be thinking of herself,
of how he had admired her because she demanded no
admiration from him. Was there an obligation demanded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
here today? And had he given grounds for such obligation?
Past question, he had.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jo, you must take me just as I am,&#8221; he said. &#8220;All the
boys are ready to crowd into any place I vacate around
Cyrus Bennington&#8217;s premises. You won&#8217;t miss one from
your company tonight. I may get desperate&mdash;and kill off
a few of them sometime to make you really miss me.&#8221;</p>
<p>He knew he was talking foolishly. He had felt himself
superior to the other young men who obeyed every wish
of Jo&#8217;s. He had been flattered always by her evident preference
for his company, and had not thought of himself
as being controlled by her before. He had been too willing
to do her bidding. Today, for the first time, her rule was
irksome. In spite of his efforts to be agreeable, the drive
homeward was not a happy one.</p>
<p>It was twilight when Thaine reached the Cloverdale
Ranch and found Leigh waiting for him on the wide porch.
All the way down the river he had been calling himself
names and letting his conscience stab him unmercifully.
And once when something spoke within him, saying, &#8220;You
never told Jo you were fond of her. You have not done
her any wrong,&#8221; he stifled back the pleasing voice and
despised himself for trying to find such excuse. He was
only nineteen and had not had the stern discipline of war
that Asher Aydelot had known at the same age.</p>
<p>Jo had offered no further complaint at his refusing her
invitation. She played the vastly more effective part of
being grieved but not angry, and her quiet good-by was
so unlike pretty imperious Jo Bennington that Thaine
was tempted to go back and spend the evening in her company.
Yet, strangely enough, he did not blame Leigh for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
being the cause of his discomfort, as he should have done.
As he neared her home, his conscience grew less and less
noisy, and when he sat at last in Jim Shirley&#8217;s easy porch
chair with Leigh in a low rocker facing him, while the long
summer Sabbath twilight was falling on the peaceful landscape
about him, he had almost forgotten Jo&#8217;s claim on him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Carey came down to see me,&#8221; Leigh was saying,
&#8220;just as you were kind enough to ask him to do. He told
me he had no money of his own to loan, but he knew of a
fund he might control in a few days. He had to leave
Kansas yesterday on a business trip, but he will see me as
soon as he comes back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better than gold! Your plans just fall together and
fit in, don&#8217;t they?&#8221; Thaine exclaimed. &#8220;Will he be back
in time, though?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. But really, Thaine,&#8221; Leigh&#8217;s eyes were beautiful
in the twilight, &#8220;I never should have thought of Doctor
Carey if it hadn&#8217;t been for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am of some use to the community after all,&#8221; Thaine
said with serious face.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a great deal of use to me,&#8221; Leigh assured him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, anybody else could do all I do for you,&#8221; he
retorted.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I wouldn&#8217;t ask anybody else,&#8221; the girl replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not even my mother? She thinks there is no girl like
you this side of heaven, or Virginia, anyhow, and she&#8217;d
have taken it up with father,&#8221; Thaine declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought of her,&#8221; Leigh answered, &#8220;but in things
like this, it is impossible. You said yourself that no man
on Grass River would think it a wise plan. Your father
won his fight out here, even his fight against the boom.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span>
We have a different wilderness to overcome, I guess. Mine
is reclaiming that Cloverdale ranch from the Champers
Company and the weeds. I don&#8217;t know where your battlefield
lies, but you&#8217;ll have it, and it&#8217;s because you haven&#8217;t
won yet that I can come to you. You have helped me
and you always will.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you came to me, anyhow,&#8221; Thaine assured her.</p>
<p>They sat awhile looking out at the prairies and the line
of the river glistening in the gloaming. A faint pink
tone edged some gray cloud flakes in the southwest sky and
all the scene was restful in the soft evening light.</p>
<p>At last Thaine said thoughtfully: &#8220;I haven&#8217;t heard
the bugle trumpet for my call to battle yet. Maybe I&#8217;ll
find out down at the University and make everybody proud
of me some day as I am proud of you in your fight for a
weed-covered quarter of prairie soil. Jo Bennington is
always ridiculing country life, and yet she&#8217;s pretty fond
of Todd Stewart, who is more of a farmer every day.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little smile curved the corners of Leigh&#8217;s mouth, and
Thaine knew her thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are not a bit alike, you two girls,&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it make any difference? There&#8217;s only one of a
kind of anything in this world, flower or fruit or leaf or
life,&#8221; Leigh added. &#8220;I found that out in painting. There&#8217;s
only one Jo, and one Pryor Gaines, and one Jane Aydelot
as I remember her back in Ohio; one anything or anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And only one Leigh in all the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was not the usual bantering tone now, and there was
something in the expression of Thaine&#8217;s handsome face;
something looking out from his dark eyes that Leigh did
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
not see, because she was looking out at the lights and
shadows of evening.</p>
<p>The sunset&#8217;s afterglow had thrown a splendor far up
the sky. In its reflected light, softened by twilight shadows,
Leigh made a picture herself that an artist might love
to paint.</p>
<p>She turned away at his words, and a quiver of pain
swept her face as Thaine leaned toward her eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Leigh, I wasn&#8217;t joking. You are so unlike anybody
else.&#8221; He broke off suddenly. But Leigh was herself
again and, smiling frankly, she added, &#8220;Let&#8217;s count our
blessings, then, and be thankful it&#8217;s no worse.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine rose at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must be going. It is after eight and I ought to be
at Bennington&#8217;s now. I am so glad, I am so honored, to
have your confidence. Won&#8217;t you keep telling me your
plans, and if I can help you, will you let me do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>He had taken Leigh&#8217;s hand in good-by and held it as he
put the question.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be so glad to have your help, for we will see things
alike, not as the older people see for us. It is only at our
age that we dare take risks. Your father and Uncle Jim
wouldn&#8217;t come to Kansas now if it were now like it was
when they were twenty-one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine did not release her hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad there is only one Leigh,&#8221; he said softly.</p>
<p>The light of his eyes and the sympathetic tone seemed
all unlike the heir of the Sunflower Ranch, yet very much
like the spirit of the father who had wrested it from the
wilderness, and the mother who had courageously shared
his every need.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know tonight where my wilderness lies. But I
hope, little girl, I hope I&#8217;ll fight as good a battle on my
frontier as my father has done&mdash;as you are doing.
Good-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>He hurried away and, falling into the gay company at
Bennington&#8217;s, was welcomed by Jo as a penitent, and
abundantly forgiven.</p>
<p>While down at Cloverdale, Leigh Shirley sat long alone,
looking with unseeing eyes at the twilight into which he
had vanished.</p>

<p>On the third day after Darley Champers had closed
with Leigh Shirley, Horace Carey walked into his
office.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Champers, how&#8217;s business?&#8221; he asked, with the
cheerful way that drew even his enemies to him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Danged bad!&#8221; Champers replied. &#8220;Rotten world is
full of danged fools who want money and ain&#8217;t satisfied
when you get it for &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you made such a sale lately?&#8221; Carey inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes; day before yesterday,&#8221; Champers replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Was it the old Jim Shirley quarter, the Cloverdale
Ranch?&#8221; the doctor asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The very place, and I&#8217;m in a devil of a fix, too,&#8221;
Darley Champers declared. &#8220;The trouble is I&#8217;m dead sure
I&#8217;ll not get the other fourteen hundred.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thomas Smith had been paid the two hundred dollars
and had fully released the land to Champers to finish the
sale. Unfortunately for Champers, Smith still hung about
Wykerton, annoying his agent so much that in a fit of
anger, Champers revealed the fact that Leigh Shirley was
the buyer of the Cloverdale Ranch. Smith&#8217;s rage was the
greater because he did not believe the price money could
be paid by a girl without resources, and against this girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
he was not now ready to move. The burden of the whole
matter now was that Darley Champers had taken his life
in his own hands by the deal. The bulldog in Champers
was roused now, and, while he was a good many things evil,
he was not a coward.</p>
<p>But for his anger this morning, he would hardly have
been so free in answering Doctor Carey&#8217;s query. Carey
was a living rebuke to him, and no man loves that force
anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, I&#8217;m in a devil of a fix,&#8221; he repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, be wise and go to a doctor in time,&#8221; Doctor
Carey said, only half in jest. &#8220;Champers, we haven&#8217;t
always worked together out here, but I guess we know
each other pretty well. I&#8217;m willing to trust you. Are you
afraid to trust me?&#8221;</p>
<p>Darley Champers leaned back in his office chair and
stared at the questioner.</p>
<p>Horace Carey&#8217;s heavy hair was very white now, although
he was hardly fifty-five years old. The decades of consecrated
service to his profession had told only in this one
feature. His face was the face of a vigorous man, and
something in his life, maybe the meaning of giving up and
the meaning of the service, he once told Jim Shirley, he
had known, had left upon his countenance their mark of
strength. As Darley Champers looked at this face, he realized,
as he had never done before, the freedom and joy of
an unsullied reputation and honest dealing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, no, I&#8217;d trust you in hell, Doc,&#8221; he exclaimed
bluntly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t put it to the proof,&#8221; the doctor assured him.
&#8220;Nor will I trouble you nor myself with any matter not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
concerning us two. Tell me frankly all the trouble about
this sale.&#8221;</p>
<p>Briefly, Champers explained Smith&#8217;s hatred of Jim Shirley,
and his anger at the present sale.</p>
<p>&#8220;All I ask is that you will not break your word to Miss
Shirley,&#8221; Horace Carey said. &#8220;I happen to know that the
money will be ready for you. This Smith is the same man
who came to old Carey&#8217;s Crossing years ago, of course?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, do you remember him?&#8221; Darley Champers asked
in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve crossed his trail a hundred times since then, and it&#8217;s
always an ill-smelling trail. Some day I may follow it a
bit myself. You&#8217;ll do well to break with him,&#8221; the doctor
assured him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Doc Carey ever starts on that hyena&#8217;s trail, I&#8217;d like
to be in at the end of the chase,&#8221; Champers declared with
a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not help a bit yourself? I&#8217;m going East for a
week. When I come back, I&#8217;ll see you. Maybe I can help
you a little to get his claws unhooked from your throat,&#8221;
Carey suggested, and the two men shook hands and
separated.</p>
<p>Champers stood up and breathed deeply. The influence
of an upright man&#8217;s presence is inspiring. Horace Carey
did not dream that his confidence and good will that day
were turning the balances for Darley Champers for the
remainder of his life. Champers was by nature a ferret,
and Carey&#8217;s parting words took root and grew in his
mind.</p>
<p>The May rains that had flooded Grass River and its
tributaries did worse for Clover Creek in Ohio a few days
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
later. The lower part of the town of Cloverdale was
uncomfortably submerged until the high railroad grade
across the creek on the Aydelot farm broke and let the
back water have broader outlet.</p>
<p>Doctor Carey had not startled the same old loafers who
kept watch over the railway station when he suddenly
dropped into the town again. They were too busy watching
the capers of Clover Creek to attend to their regular
post of duty. And since he had been a guest of Miss Jane
Aydelot as much as a half dozen times in two decades, they
knew about what to expect of him now.</p>
<p>They were more interested in a big bluff stranger who
dropped into town off the early morning train, ate a plentiful
meal at the depot restaurant, and then strolled down to
the creek. He loitered all day about the spot where the
grade broke, nor did he leave the place when the crowd was
called away late in the afternoon to a little stream on the
other side of town that had suddenly risen to be a river for
the first time in the memory of man.</p>
<p>To Doctor Carey, Jane Aydelot looked scarce a day
older for the dozen years gone by. Her days were serene
and full of good works. Such women do not lose the
charm of youth until late in life.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have come for help, as you told me to do when I took
Leigh away,&#8221; Doctor Carey said as they sat on the south
veranda in the pleasant light of the May evening.</p>
<p>Jane Aydelot&#8217;s face was expectant. Nobody except Doctor
Carey knew how a little hungry longing in her eyes
disappeared when he made his brief visits and crept back
again when he said good-by.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am waiting always to help you,&#8221; she replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I need fourteen hundred dollars to loan to Leigh, and
I must have that sum at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miss Jane looked thoughtfully at the deep woodland,
hiding the marshes as of old.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can arrange it,&#8221; she said presently. &#8220;Tell me
about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Horace Carey told her all of Leigh&#8217;s plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a wonderful undertaking for a girl, but she has
faith in herself, and if she fails, the land is abundantly
worth the mortgage with nothing but weeds on it,&#8221; the
doctor explained. &#8220;She is a charming girl. She seems to
have inherited all of her mother&#8217;s sweetness and artistic
gifts, without her mother&#8217;s submissiveness to others; and
from her father, she has keen business qualities, but fails
to inherit his love of gain and traits of trickery. Her
executive mind with her uncle&#8217;s good heart make a winning
team. By the way, my affection for Jim Shirley is leading
me to make some quiet investigation of an agent of Tank&#8217;s
who is hounding Jim and will, I suppose, turn against
Leigh. Can you help me at all?&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Carey had always felt that Miss Jane knew much
more than she cared to tell of the Shirley family&#8217;s affairs.</p>
<p>She rose without replying and went into the house. In
a few minutes she returned and gave a large sealed envelope
into Doctor Carey&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not use that until it is needed to protect someone
from Tank Shirley&#8217;s violence. It is legally drawn and witnessed.
You will find it effective if it is needed at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have one more duty, Miss Aydelot,&#8221; Doctor Carey
said. &#8220;My time is brief. I have an intuition, too, that I
may never come East again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span></p>
<p>Jane Aydelot&#8217;s face whitened, and her hands closed involuntarily
on one another as she waited.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have you and Asher Aydelot reconciled. What
can I tell him of you?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pink flush returned to the pale cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him read my will. I copied it when I had your
telegram two days ago. I cannot give him my property;
Uncle Francis&#8217; will forbids it. But&mdash;take the copy with
you. I hope my wishes will be realized.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Carey held her hand long when he bade her
good-by. In her clear gray eyes he read a story that gave
him infinite sorrow. Stooping down, he put his arm gently
about her shoulders and, drawing her to him, kissed her once
on her forehead, and once&mdash;just once&mdash;on her lips, and
was gone.</p>
<p>They never met again. But those who knew her best
in Cloverdale remember yet that from the Maytime of that
year, Miss Jane&#8217;s face was glorified with a light never
there before.</p>
<p>Down at the creek, Doctor Carey saw a large man intently
studying the bank beyond the break in the railroad
grade. Something made the doctor pass slowly, for the
figure appealed to his interest. Presently, the man turned
away and, climbing up to the National pike road before
him, made his way into town. As the last light of evening
fell full upon him, it revealed to Doctor Carey a very white
face, and eyes that stared, as if seeing nothing&mdash;even the
bluff face and huge form of Darley Champers.</p>
<p>Two weeks later when Darley Champers gave Leigh
Shirley the deed in her own name to the Cloverdale Ranch,
he said, in his bluff way:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sayin&#8217; nothin&#8217; against Jim Shirley, madam, when
I say I hope you&#8217;ll keep this in your own name. Some
day you&#8217;ll know why. And I hope to Gawd you&#8217;ll prosper
with it. It&#8217;s cost more&#8217;n the money paid out for it to get
that quarter section of prairie out of the wilderness. Sorrow
and disappointment, bad management, and blasted
hopes, and hard work, and hate. But I reckon it&#8217;s clean
hands and a pure heart, as the Good Book says, that you
are usin&#8217; now. This money don&#8217;t represent all it&#8217;ll cost me
yet by a danged sight.&#8221;</p>
<p>He bade her a hearty good-by and strode away.</p>
<p>The mortgage for the loan was given to Horace Carey,
as agreed upon between himself and Miss Jane Aydelot.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Leigh knows it&#8217;s Aydelot money she might feel
like she&#8217;s taking what should be Thaine&#8217;s. Would the
Aydelots feel the same if they knew it?&#8221; Miss Jane had
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing the Aydelots have never grieved for is this
Ohio inheritance,&#8221; Carey answered her. &#8220;Asher gave it
up to live his life in his own way. If you knew what a
prince of a fellow he is, although he&#8217;s only a Kansas
farmer, you would understand how that prairie ranch and
the lure of the sunflower have gripped him to the West,&#8221;</p>
<p>The day after the completion of the sale Dr. Carey
went to the Big Wolf neighborhood. In the dusk of the
evening he drove up to Darley Champers&#8217; office in Wykerton.
As he was hitching his team Rosie Gimpke rushed
out of the side street and lunged across to the hitching
post.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Doctor Carey, coom queek mit me,&#8221; she exclaimed
in a whisper. &#8220;Coom, I just got here from Mis&#8217; Aydelot&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
They mak&#8217; me coom home to work at the Wyker House,
ant a man get hurt bad in there. Coom, do coom,&#8221; she
urged in a frenzy of eagerness.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble?&#8221; Dr. Carey asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coom. I show you. I &#8217;fraid the man coom back and
finish heem. Don&#8217;t make no noise, but coom.&#8221; Rosie was
clutching hard at Dr. Carey&#8217;s arm as she whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds surprising, but life is full of surprises,&#8221;
the doctor thought as he took up his medicine case and
followed Rosie&#8217;s lead.</p>
<p>The way took them to the alley behind the Wyker
House, through a rear gate to the back door of the kitchen,
from which it was a short step to the little &#8220;blind tiger&#8221;
beyond the dining room. Sounds of boisterous talking and
laughter and a general shuffling of dishes told that the
evening meal was beginning. For her size and clumsiness
Rosie whisked the doctor deftly out of sight and joined
the ranks of the waiters in the dining room.</p>
<p>The only light inside the little room came from the
upper half of the one window looking toward the alley.
As it was already twilight the doctor did not get his
bearings until a huge form on the floor near the table
made an effort to rise.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble here?&#8221; Carey asked in the sympathetic-professional
voice by which he controlled sick rooms.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, Doc, is that you?&#8221; Darley Champers followed
the words with a groan.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are in a fix,&#8221; Carey replied as he lifted Champers
to his feet.</p>
<p>Blood was on his face and clothes and the floor, and
Champers himself was almost too weak to stand.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Get me out of here as quick as you can, Doc,&#8221; he said
in a thick voice.</p>
<p>At the same moment Rosie Gimpke appeared from the
kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slip him out queek now. I hold the dining room door
tight,&#8221; she urged, rushing back to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Carey moved quickly and had Darley Champers safely
out and into his own office before Rosie had need to relax
her grip on the dining room door-knob.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;ve saved me,&#8221; Champers said faintly as the
doctor examined his wounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as bad as that,&#8221; Dr. Carey replied cheerfully.
&#8220;An ugly scalp wound and loss of blood, but you&#8217;ll come
back all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a kick in the abdomen,&#8221; Champers groaned. &#8220;But
it was from what was comin&#8217; you saved me. I&#8217;ve never
been sick a day in my life and I&#8217;ve had little sympathy for
you and your line, and then to be knocked down so quick
by a little whiffet like Smith and roll over like a log at
the first blow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re in luck. Most men in your line ought to have
been knocked down a good many times before now,&#8221; the
doctor declared. &#8220;How did this happen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I settled with Smith and made him sign everything
up to a hog-tight contract. Then he started in to abuse
me till I got tired and told him I&#8217;d just got back from
Ohio and a thing or two I saw there. Then he suddenly
belted me and, against all rules of the game, kicked me
when I was down, and left me, threatening to come back
and finish me. That&#8217;s what you saved me from.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Champers, my old buggy is like a rocking chair. Let
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
me take you home with me for a few days while you are
wearing patches on your head,&#8221; Horace Carey suggested.</p>
<p>Darley Champers stared at his helper in surprise. Then
he said slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Doc, I&#8217;ve hated you a good many years for doin&#8217;
just such tricks for folks. It was my cussedness made me
do it, I reckon. I&#8217;d like to get out of town a little
while. That joint of Wyker&#8217;s has seen more&#8217;n one fellow
laid out, and some of &#8217;em went down Big Wolf later, and
some of &#8217;em fell into Little Wolf and never come out. It&#8217;s
a hole, I tell you. And Smith is a devil tonight.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the homeward way Dr. Carey said quietly:</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, Champers, I saw you at Cloverdale, Ohio,
last week.&#8221;</p>
<p>Champers did not start nor seem surprised as he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I seen you, but I didn&#8217;t want to speak to nobody
right then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No?&#8221; Dr. Carey questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;ve got hold enough of Smith now to make him
afraid of me if I&#8217;d turn loose. I&#8217;d a made money by doin&#8217;
it, too. Good clean money. That&#8217;s why he&#8217;s gettin&#8217; good
and drunk to beat me up again tonight, maybe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t you tighten up on him? Why let a
scoundrel like that run free?&#8221; Carey inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it might drag Leigh Shirley&#8217;s name into the
muss. And I&#8217;m no devourer of widders and orphans; I&#8217;m
a humane man, and I&#8217;ll let Smith run till his tether snaps
and he falls over the precipice and breaks his neck for
hisself. Besides I&#8217;m not sure now whether he&#8217;s a agent,
representin&#8217; some principal, or the principal representin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
hisself. And in that case I&#8217;d have to deal the cards different
for him, and them he&#8217;d do harm to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a humane man, Champers,&#8221; Carey declared.
&#8220;I think I&#8217;ve hated you, too, a good many years. These
gray hairs of ours ought to make us better behaved now.
But, even if you do let Smith run, that &#8217;blind tiger&#8217; of
Wyker&#8217;s must go out of business. I&#8217;ll start John Jacobs
after that hole one of these days. He holds the balance
of power on public sentiment out here. He&#8217;ll clear it out.
His hatred of saloons is like Smith&#8217;s hatred of Shirley,
only it&#8217;s a righteous indignation. I&#8217;ve heard John&#8217;s father
was a drunkard and his mother followed her husband into
a saloon in Cincinnati to persuade him out and was killed
by a drunken tough. Anyhow, John will break up that
game of Wyker&#8217;s one of these times. See if he doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Darley Champers slowly shifted his huge frame into an
easier posture as he replied:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he can do it all right. But mark me, now, the
day he runs Hans Wyker out of that doggery business
it will be good-by to John Jacobs. You see if it isn&#8217;t.
I wouldn&#8217;t start him after it too quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>Darley Champers spent two weeks with his physician,
and the many friends of Dr. Carey smiled and agreed
with Todd Stewart, who declared:</p>
<p>&#8220;Carey would win Satan to be his fast friend if the Old
Scratch would only let Carey doctor him once.&#8221;</p>
<p>But nobody understood how the awakening of the latent
manhood in Darley Champers and his determination to
protect an orphan girl were winning the doctor to him
as well.</p>

<p>The summer ran its hot length of days, but it was a
gay season for the second generation in the Grass
River Valley. Nor drouth nor heat can much annoy when
the heart beats young. September would see the first scattering
of the happy company for the winter. The last
grand rally for the crowd came late in August. Two
hayrack loads of young folks, with some few in carriages,
were to spend the day at &#8220;The Cottonwoods,&#8221; a far-away
picnic ground toward the three headlands of the southwest.
Few of the company had ever visited the place. Distances
are deceiving on the prairies and better picnic grounds lay
nearer to Grass River.</p>
<p>On the afternoon before the picnic Leigh Shirley took
her work to the lawn behind the house.</p>
<p>What most ranches gave over to weed patches, or hog
lots, or dumping grounds along the stream, at Cloverdale
had become a shady clover-sodded lawn sloping down to
the river&#8217;s edge. The biggest cottonwoods and elms in the
whole valley grew on this lawn. A hedge of lilac and
other shrubbery bordered by sunflowers and hollyhocks
bounded it from the fields and trellises of white honeysuckle
screened it from the road.</p>

Leigh turned to see Thaine Aydelot looking down at her as he leaned over the high back of the rustic seat<br />

<p>In a rustic seat overlooking the river and the prairies
beyond, Leigh Shirley bent lovingly above a square of
heavy white paper on which she was sketching a group of
sunflowers glowing in the afternoon sunlight. Leigh&#8217;s
talent was only an undeveloped inheritance, but if it lacked
training it&#8217;s fresh originality was unspoiled.</p>
<p>&#8220;The top of the afternoon to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh turned to see Thaine Aydelot looking down at
her as he leaned over the high back of the rustic seat. He
was in his working clothes with his straw hat set back,
showing his brown face. His luminous dark eyes were
shining and a half-teasing, half-sympathetic smile was on
his lips. But whatever the clothes, there was always something
of the Southern gentleman about every man of the
Thaine blood. Something of the soldierly bearing of his
father had been his heritage likewise.</p>
<p>&#8220;May I see your stuff, or is it not for the profane eyes
of a thresher of alfalfa to look upon?&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh drew back and held up her drawing-board.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just like you, Leigh. You always were an artist,
but when did you learn all the technique? Is that what
you call it? How do you do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; Leigh answered frankly. &#8220;It seems to
do itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And why do you do it? Or why don&#8217;t you do more
of it?&#8221; Thaine asked.</p>
<p>The girl answered, smiling:</p>
<p>&#8220;Just between us two, I hope to do a piece good enough
to sell and help to lift the price of alfalfa seed a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By the way, I brought the first load of seed over just
now. Where&#8217;s Uncle Jim?&#8221; Thaine asked, trying not to
let the pity in his heart show itself in his eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Uncle Jim is breaking sod&mdash;weeds, I mean&mdash;for fall
sowing. Wait a minute and I&#8217;ll get you the money he left
for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine threw himself down in the shade beside Leigh&#8217;s
seat while she went into the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I didn&#8217;t have to take that money, but I know
better than to say a word,&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;Thank
the Lord, the worried look is beginning to leave Uncle
Jim&#8217;s face, though. How could any of us get along
without Uncle Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What little seed to be worth so much, but it&#8217;s the beginning
of conquest,&#8221; Leigh said as Thaine took the bills
from her hand. &#8220;And it&#8217;s a much more hopeful business
to reclaim from booms and weeds than from this lonely old
prairie as it was when Uncle Jim and your father first
came here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just the same old pioneer spirit, though, and you
are fighting a mortgage just like they fought loneliness,
and besides, Asher Aydelot had Virginia Thaine to help
him to keep his courage up.&#8221;</p>
<p>A sudden flush deepened on his ruddy cheeks and he
continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you are going to the picnic? You&#8217;ll have
to start early. It&#8217;s a goodish way to &#8217;The Cottonwoods.&#8217;
The Sunflower Ranch needs my talents, so I can&#8217;t go with
the crowd, but I may draggle in about high noon. I&#8217;ll
drive over in the buggy, and I&#8217;ll try to snake some pretty
girl off the wagons to ride home with me when it&#8217;s all over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the pretty girls will all be preempted before
you get there,&#8221; Leigh replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know one that I hope won&#8217;t be,&#8221; Thaine said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></p>
<p>Leigh was bending over her drawing board and did not
look up for a long minute. It was her gift to make comfort
about her while she followed her own will unflinchingly.
The breeze had blown the golden edges of her hair into
fluffy ripples about her forehead and the deep blue of
August skies was reflected in her blue eyes shaded by their
long brown lashes. Thaine sat watching her every motion,
as he always did when he was with her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Leigh looked up with the query. &#8220;And
what&#8217;s to hinder your getting the pretty girl you want if
she understands and you are swift enough to cut off the
enemy from a flank movement?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The girl herself,&#8221; Thaine replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Serious! Tragical! Won&#8217;t you give me that chrome-yellow
tube by your elbow there?&#8221; Leigh reached for the
paint and their hands met.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, little Sketcher of Things, will you be missing me
when I go to school next month? Or will your art and
your ranch take all your thoughts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish they would, but they won&#8217;t,&#8221; Leigh said.
&#8220;They will help to fill up the time, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Leigh, may I bring you home tomorrow night? I&#8217;m
going away the next day, and I won&#8217;t see you any more
for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, you may not,&#8221; Leigh replied, looking up, and
her sunny face framed by her golden brown hair was
winsomely pleasing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not, Leigh? Am I too late?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Too early. You haven&#8217;t asked Jo and been refused
yet. But you are kind to put me on the &#8216;waiting list.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine was standing beside her now.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I mean it. Has anybody asked you specially&mdash;to be
your very particular escort?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes. The very nicest of the crowd.&#8221; Leigh&#8217;s eyes
were shining now. &#8220;But I&#8217;ve refused him,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine Aydelot, and I refused because it was good
taste for me to do it. If it&#8217;s his last day at home&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
I forget what I was going to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you wouldn&#8217;t make a joke of it, anyhow. Tell
me why you are so unkind to an old neighbor and lifelong
pal,&#8221; Thaine insisted.</p>
<p>But Leigh made no reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leigh!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me why you insist when by all the rules you are
due to snake the prettiest girl in the crowd off the wagon
and into your buggy. Why aren&#8217;t you satisfied to make
the other boys all envy you?&#8221; Leigh had risen and stood
beside the rustic seat, her arm across its high back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because it is the last time. Because we&#8217;ve known each
other since childhood and have been playmates, chums,
companions; because I am going one way and you another,
and our paths may widen more and more, and because&mdash;oh,
Leigh, because I want you.&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned against the back of the seat and gently put
one hand on her arm.</p>
<p>The yellow August sunshine lay on the level prairies
beyond the river. The shining thread of waters wound
away across the landscape under a play of light and
shadow. The clover sod at their feet was soft and green.
The big golden sunflowers hung on their stalks along the
border of the lawn, and overhead the ripple of the summer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
breezes in the cottonwoods made a music like pattering
raindrops. Under their swaying boughs Leigh Shirley
stood, a fair, sweet girl. And nothing in the languorous
beauty of the midsummer afternoon could have been quite
so pleasing without her presence there.</p>
<p>She looked down at Thaine&#8217;s big brown hand resting
against her white arm, and then up to his handsome face.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would only make trouble for, for everybody. No,
I&#8217;m coming home with the crowd on the hayrack.&#8221; She
lifted her arm and began to pull the petals from a tiny
sunflower that lay on the seat beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221; There was no anger in Thaine&#8217;s tone.
&#8220;Do you remember the big sunflower we found to send
to Prince Quippi, once?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The one that should bring him straight from China
to me, if he really cared for me?&#8221; Leigh asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said that one was to tell him that you loved him
and you knew it would bring him to you. But he never
came.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a way my princes have of doing,&#8221; Leigh said with
a little laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were in China and you should send me a sunflower,
I&#8217;d know you wanted me to come back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I ever send you one you will know that I do,&#8221;
Leigh said. &#8220;Meantime, my prince will wear a sprig of
alfalfa on his coat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a cockle burr in his whiskers, and cerulean blue
overalls like mine, and he&#8217;ll drudge along in a slow scrap
with the soil till the soil gets him,&#8221; Thaine added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Like it got your father,&#8221; Leigh commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, he&#8217;s just one sort of a man by himself,&#8221; Thaine
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
declared. &#8220;A pretty good sort, of course, else I&#8217;d never
have recommended him to be my father. Good-by. I&#8217;ll
see you across the crowd tomorrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned at once and left her.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cottonwoods&#8221; was a picturesque little grove
grown in the last decade about a rocky run down which
in the springtime a full stream swept. There was only a
little ripple over a stony bed now, with shallow pools lost
in the deeper basins here and there. The grasses lay flat
and brown on the level prairie about it. Down the shaded
valley a light cool breeze poured steadily. Beyond the
stream a gentle slope reached far away to the foot of the
three headlands&mdash;the purple notches of Thaine Aydelot&#8217;s
childhood fancies.</p>
<p>The day was ideal. Such days come sometimes in a
Kansas August. The young people of the Grass River
neighborhood had made merry half of the morning in the
grove, and as they gathered for the picnic lunch someone
called out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Jo Bennington, where&#8217;s Thaine Aydelot? Great note
for him to disappear when this Charity Ball was executed
mainly for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better ask Todd Stewart. He&#8217;s probably had Thaine
kidnaped for this occasion,&#8221; somebody else suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tried to do it and failed,&#8221; Todd Stewart assented.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t need him in my business. He can start to school
today if he wants to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you don&#8217;t want him to go, do you, Jo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t care especially. I&#8217;m going away myself,
but not to the University, but I&#8217;m not going till papa&#8217;s
elected,&#8221; Jo replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And if papa&#8217;s defeated we stay home all winter, eh?&#8221;
Todd questioned.</p>
<p>&#8220;That all depends,&#8221; Jo replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it does. What is it, and who depends on it?
Jo, I&#8217;ll help you if you must defend yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine Aydelot bounced down from the rocky bank
above into the midst of the company and became at once
Jo&#8217;s escort by common consent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now life&#8217;s worth living, Thaine&#8217;s here. Let&#8217;s have
dinner,&#8221; the boys urged.</p>
<p>It was not Leigh Shirley&#8217;s fault that Thaine should be
placed between her and Jo at the spread of good things
to eat; nor Jo&#8217;s planning that she should be between
Thaine and Todd Stewart. But nobody could be unhappy
today.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon the crowd strolled in couples and
quartettes and groups up and down the picturesque place.</p>
<p>Thaine had been with Jo from the moment of his coming
and Leigh was glad that she had not yielded to his
request of the afternoon before. She had become a little
separated from the company as she followed a trail of
golden sunflowers down the edge of the wide space between
the stream and the foot of the headlands towering far
beyond it. The sun had disappeared suddenly and the
gleam of the blossoms dulled a trifle. Leigh sat down on
a slab of shale to study the effect of the shadow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you still looking for a letter that will bring
Prince Quippi back?&#8221; Thaine Aydelot asked as he climbed
up from the rough stream bed to a seat beside her.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m watching the effect of sunshine and shadow on
the sunflowers,&#8221; Leigh replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It will be all shadow if you wait much longer. The
clouds are gathering now and we must start home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must be going, too. It&#8217;s a lovely, lazy place
here, though. Some time I&#8217;m going to the top of those
bluffs, away off there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go up now,&#8221; Thaine suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s too late. I mustn&#8217;t keep the crowd waiting,&#8221;
Leigh insisted. &#8220;It&#8217;s a stiff climb, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can drive up. I know a trail through the brush.
Let me drive you up, Leigh. It won&#8217;t take long. There&#8217;s
something worth seeing up there,&#8221; Thaine insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, be quick, Thaine. We&#8217;ll get into trouble if we
are late,&#8221; Leigh declared.</p>
<p>The trail up the steep slope twisted its way back and
forth through the low timber that covered the sides of the
bluffs, and the two in the buggy found themselves shut
away in its solitary windings.</p>
<p>&#8220;What a shadowy road,&#8221; Leigh said. &#8220;And see that
cliff dropping down beyond that turn. How could there
be such a romantic place out on these level plains?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was my fairy land when I was a little tot,&#8221; Thaine
replied. &#8220;I came here long ago and explored it myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to come here sketching sometime. See how
the branches meet overhead. The odors from the bluffside
are like the odors of the woodland back in the Clover valley
in Ohio. I remember them yet, although I was so little
when I left there,&#8221; Leigh said, turning to Thaine.</p>
<p>He shifted the reins, and throwing his hat in the buggy
before him he pushed back the hair from his forehead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leigh, will you let me take you home? I didn&#8217;t ask
Jo after all. Todd wouldn&#8217;t wait long enough for me to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
do that, as I knew well enough he wouldn&#8217;t. Don&#8217;t be
mad at me. Please don&#8217;t,&#8221; he pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m glad if you really want me to go with you,
but you shouldn&#8217;t have staid away this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did it on purpose. I knew Todd wouldn&#8217;t let the
chance slip&mdash;nor Jo neither, if I let him have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You let him have it merely because you didn&#8217;t want
the chance today. Your kindness will be your undoing
some day,&#8221; Leigh said with a smile that took off the edge
of sarcasm.</p>
<p>Thaine said nothing in response, and they climbed slowly
to the top of the bluff and stood at last on the crest of
the middle headland.</p>
<p>Below them lay &#8220;The Cottonwoods&#8221; and the winding
stream whose course, marked by the dark green line of
shrubbery, stretched away toward Grass River far to the
southeast. To the westward a wonderful vista of level
prairie spread endlessly, wherein no line of shrubbery
marked a watercourse nor tree rose up to break the circle
of the horizon. Over all this vast plain the three headlands
stood as sentinels. In the west the sunlight had
pierced a heavy cloudbank and was pouring through the
rift in one broad sheet of gold mist from sky to earth.
Purple and silver and burnt umber, with green and gray
and richest orange, blended all in the tones of the landscape,
overhung now by a storm-girdled sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;This prairie belongs mostly to John Jacobs now and it
is just as it was when the Indians called it the Grand
Prairie and the old Pawnees came down here every summer
to hunt buffalo. Some day, soon, there will be a sea of
wheat flowing over all that level plain,&#8221; Thaine said.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And up here a home with nothing to cut off a fragment
of the whole horizon. Think of seeing every sunrise
and every sunset from a place like this,&#8221; Leigh said, her
face aglow with an artist&#8217;s love of beauty. &#8220;It&#8217;s farther
to China than I used to think when I dreamed of a purple
velvet house decorated with gold knobs beyond these three
headlands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I always did want to live on the Purple Notches,&#8221;
Thaine said reminiscently. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad we came up here today.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sound of singing came faintly up from the valley
far away.</p>
<p>&#8220;The crowd is mobilized. See the wagons crawling out
of the grove and the civilians in citizens&#8217; clothes following
in carriages,&#8221; Thaine said as he watched the picnic party
pushing out toward the eastward. &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad we aren&#8217;t
with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh sat leaning forward, looking at the majestic distances
lost in purple haze, overshadowed by purple clouds
with gold-broidered edges of sunlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;The world is all ours for once. We see all there is
of it and yet we are alone in it up here on the purple
notches I used to dream about,&#8221; she said softly.</p>
<p>Thaine leaned back in his buggy and looked at Leigh
with the same impenetrable expression on his countenance
that was always there when she was present.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leigh,&#8221; he said at last, &#8220;if you didn&#8217;t have Uncle
Jim what would you do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; the girl answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never knew one of the fellows who didn&#8217;t like you,
but you, you don&#8217;t seem to care for any of them. Don&#8217;t
they suit you?&#8221; Thaine asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I can&#8217;t think much about them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh drew a long breath.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine, you have always been a good friend to me.
Some day I&#8217;ll tell you why.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me now,&#8221; Thaine insisted gently.</p>
<p>Leigh looked up, a mist of tears in her violet eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, little girl, forgive me. It&#8217;s because&mdash;because,&#8221;
Thaine hesitated. &#8220;Because deep down where nobody ever
knew I&#8217;ve loved you always, Leigh. I didn&#8217;t know how
much until the night of my party and the day we were at
Wykerton.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine! Thaine! you mustn&#8217;t say such things,&#8221; Leigh
cried, gripping her hands together. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t! You
mustn&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I must, and I will,&#8221; Thaine declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I won&#8217;t listen to you. You are a flirt. Not
satisfied with making one girl love you, you want to make
all of us care for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you mean. I thought I loved Jo. Then
I knew I didn&#8217;t, and I felt in honor bound to keep her
from finding it out. But that&#8217;s a dead failure of a business.
You can&#8217;t play that game and win. I&#8217;ve learned a good
many things this summer, and one of them is that Todd
Stewart is the only one who really and truly loves Jo, and
she cares as much for him as she does for anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; Leigh asked as she leaned back
now and faced Thaine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because she doesn&#8217;t know herself yet. She&#8217;s too spoiled
by the indulgence of everybody and too pretty. She wants
attention. But I found finally, maybe mother helped me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
a little, that if she has Todd&#8217;s attention she&#8217;s satisfied.
More, she&#8217;s comfortable. She was always on thorns with
me. Isn&#8217;t that enough about Jo?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well?&#8221; Leigh queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, nothing is well yet. Leigh, let me go away to the
University. Let me make a name for myself, a world-wide
name, maybe, let me fight on my frontier line and then
come back and lift the burden you carry now. I want to
do big things somewhere away from the Kansas prairies,
away from the grind of the farm and country life. Oh,
Leigh, you are the only girl I ever can really love.&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned forward and took her hands in his own, his
dark eyes, beautiful with the light of love, looking down
into hers, his face aglow with the ambition of undisciplined
youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me help you,&#8221; he pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is only sympathy you offer, Thaine, and I don&#8217;t
want sympathy. You said that game wouldn&#8217;t win with
Jo. Neither would it with me. I am happy in my work.
I&#8217;m not afraid of it. The harder part is to get enough
money to buy seed and pay interest, and Uncle Jim and
I will earn that. I tell you the mortgage must be lifted by
alfalfa roots just as Coburn&#8217;s book says it will be.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a defiant little curve on her red lips and the
brave hopefulness of her face was inspiring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go and do your work, Thaine. Fight your battles,
push back your frontier line, win your wilderness, and
make a world-wide name for yourself. But when all is
done don&#8217;t forget that the fight your father and mother
made here, and are making today, is honorable, wonderful;
and that the winning of a Kansas farm, the kingdom of

golden wheat, bordered round by golden sunflowers, is a
real kingdom. Its sinews of strength uphold the nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you eloquent little Jayhawker!&#8221; Thaine exclaimed.
&#8220;You should have been an orator on the side,
not an artist. But all this only makes me care the more.
I&#8217;m proud of you. I&#8217;d want you for my chum if you
were a boy. I want you for my friend, but down under all
this I want you for my girl now, and afterwhile, Leigh, I
want you for my own, all mine. Don&#8217;t you care for me?
Couldn&#8217;t you learn to care, Leigh? Couldn&#8217;t you go with
me to a broader life somewhere out in the real big world?
Couldn&#8217;t we come some time to the Purple Notches and
build a home for just our summer days, because we have
seen these headlands all our lives?&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh&#8217;s head was bowed, and the pink blooms left her
cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine,&#8221; she said in a low voice that thrilled him with
its sweetness, &#8220;I do care. I have always cared so much
that I have hoped this moment might never come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine caught her arm eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;No! no! We can never, never be anything but friends,
and if you care more than that for me now, if you really
love me&mdash;&#8221;the voice was very soft&mdash;&#8220;don&#8217;t ask me
why. I cannot tell you, but I know we can never be anything
more than friends, never, never.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sorrow on her white face, the pathos of the great
violet eyes, the firm outline of the red lips told Thaine
Aydelot that words were hopeless. He had known her
every mood from childhood. She never dallied nor hesitated.
The grief of her answer went too deep for words
to argue against. And withal Thaine Aydelot was very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
proud and unaccustomed to being denied what he chose
to want very much.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leigh, will you do two things for me?&#8221; he asked at
length. The sad, quiet tone was unlike Thaine Aydelot.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I can,&#8221; Leigh answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;First, will you promise me that if you want me you
will send for me. If you ever find&mdash;oh, Leigh, ever is
such a long word. If you ever think you can care enough
for me to let me come back to you, you will let me know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I send you the little sunflower letter Prince
Quippi never answered you may come back,&#8221; Leigh said
lightly, but the tears were too near for the promise to seem
trivial. &#8220;What is the other thing?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I want you just once to let me kiss you, Leigh. It&#8217;s
our good-by kiss forever. Hereafter we are only friends,
old chums, you know. Will you let me be your lover for
one minute up here on the Purple Notches, where the
whole world lies around us and nobody knows our secret?
Please, Leigh. Then I&#8217;ll go away and be a man somewhere
in the big world that&#8217;s always needing men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh leaned toward him, and he held her close as he
kissed her red lips. In all the stormy days that followed
the memory of that moment was with him. A moment when
love, in all its purity and joy, knew its first realization.</p>
<p>The next day Leigh Shirley made butter all the morning,
and in the afternoon she tried to retouch her sketch of
sunflowers as she had seen the shadows dull the brightness
of their petals in the valley below the Purple Notches.</p>
<p>The same day Thaine Aydelot left home for the winter,
taking the memory of the most sacred moment of his life
with him out into the big world that is always needing men.</p>

<p>The sunny plains of Kansas were fair and full of
growing in the spring of 1898. The alfalfa creeping
out against the weeds of the old Cloverdale Ranch was
green under the April sunshine. The breezes sweeping
down the Grass River Valley carried a vigor in their caress.
The Aydelot grove, just budding into leaf, was full of
wild birds&#8217; song. All the sights and sounds and odors of
springtime made the April day entrancing on the Kansas
prairies.</p>
<p>Leigh Shirley had risen at dawn and come up to the
grove in the early morning. She tethered her pony to
graze by the roadside, and with her drawing board on a
slender easel she stood on the driveway across the lakelet,
busy for awhile with her paints and pencil. Then the
sweetness of the morning air, the gurgling waters at the
lake&#8217;s outlet, once the little draw choked with wild plum
bushes, and the trills of music from the shimmering boughs
above her head, all combined to make dreaming pleasant.
She dropped her brushes and stood looking at the lake and
the bit of open woodland, and through it to the wide level
fields beyond, with the river gleaming here and there under
the touch of the morning light.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></p>
<p>She recalled in contrast the silver and sable tones of the
May night when she and Thaine sat on the driveway and
saw the creamy water lilies open their hearts to the wooing
moonlight and the caressing shadows. It was a fairyland
here that night. It was plain daylight now, beautiful, but
real. Life seemed a dream that night. It was very real
this April morning. The young artist involuntarily drew
a deep breath that was half a sigh and stooped to pick up
her fallen brushes. But she dropped them again with a
glad cry. Far across the lake, in the leaf-checkered sunshine,
Thaine Aydelot stood smiling at her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I stay here and spoil your landscape or come
around and shake hands?&#8221; he called across to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, come over here and tell me how you happened,&#8221;
Leigh cried eagerly.</p>
<p>Grass River people blamed the two years of the University
life for breaking Thaine Aydelot&#8217;s interest in Jo
Bennington. Not that Jo lacked for admirers without him.
Life had been made so pleasant for her that she had not
gone away to any school, even after her father&#8217;s election
to office. And down at the University the pretty girls
considered Thaine perfectly heartless, for now in his second
year they were still baffled by his general admiration and
undivided indifference toward all of them. His eager face
as he came striding up the driveway to meet Leigh Shirley
would have been a revelation to them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;happened&#8217; last night, too late to-wake up the dog,&#8221;
Thaine exclaimed. &#8220;I happened to run against Dr. Carey,
who had a hurry-up call down this way, and he happened
to drop me at the Sunflower Inn. He&#8217;s coming by for
breakfast at my urgent demand. This country night
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
practice is enough to kill a doctor. His hair is whiter than
ever, young as he is. He said he is going to take a trip
out West and have a vacation right soon. I told him all
my plans. You can tell him anything, you know. And,
besides, I&#8217;m hoping he will beat me to the house this morning
and will tell the folks I&#8217;m here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t your mother know you are here?&#8221; Leigh
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet. I wanted to come down early and tell the
lake good-by. I have to leave again in a few hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>The old impenetrable expression had dropped over his
face with the words. And nobody knows why the sunshine
grew dull and the birds&#8217; songs dropped to busy twittering
about unimportant things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you always tell it good-by?&#8221; Leigh asked, because
she could think of nothing else to say.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not always, but this time it&#8217;s different. I&#8217;m so glad I
found you. I should have gone down to Cloverdale, of
course, if you hadn&#8217;t been here, but this saves time.&#8221;</p>
<p>A pink wave swept Leigh&#8217;s cheek, but she smiled a
pleasant recognition of his thoughtfulness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come home to say good-by because I&#8217;m going to
enlist in the first Kansas regiment that goes to Cuba to
fight the Spaniards. And I must hurry back to Lawrence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Thaine! What do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh&#8217;s face was very white.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine caught her arm in time to save the light easel
from being thrown over.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t look at me that way, Leigh. Don&#8217;t you know
that President McKinley has declared war and has called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
for one hundred and twenty-five thousand volunteers? Four
or five thousand from old Kansas. Do you reckon we
Jayhawkers will wait till one hundred and twenty thousand
have enlisted and trail in on the last five thousand? It
would be against all traditions of the rude forefathers of
the Sunflower State.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Has war really been declared? We haven&#8217;t had the
papers for nearly a week. Everybody is so busy with farm
work right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh stood looking anxiously at Thaine.</p>
<p>&#8220;Declared! The first gun has been fired. The call for
volunteers has come from Washington, and the Governor
has said he will make Fred Funston Colonel of the first
regiment of Kansas volunteers, and he sent out his appeal
for loyal Kansas men to offer themselves. I tell you again,
Leigh Shirley, I&#8217;ll not be the one hundred and twenty-five
thousandth man in the line. I&#8217;m going to be right close
up to little Fred Funston, our Kansas boy, who is to be our
Colonel. I have a notion that University students will
make the right kind of soldiers. There will be plenty of
ignorance and disloyalty and drafting into line on the
Spanish side. America must send an intelligent private if
the war is to be fought out quickly. I&#8217;m that intelligent
gentleman.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why must we fight at all, Thaine? Spain has
her islands in every sea. We are almost an inland country.
Spain is a naval power. Who ever heard of the United
States being a naval power? I don&#8217;t understand what is
back of all this fuss.&#8221; Leigh asked the questions eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;We fight because we remember the Maine,&#8221; Thaine said
a little boastfully. &#8220;We are keeping in mind the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
hundred and sixty-six American sailors who perished when our
good ship was sunk in the harbor at Havana last February.
If we aren&#8217;t a naval power now we may develop some
sinews of strength before we are through. Your Uncle
Sam is a nervy citizen, and it was a sorry day for proud
old Spain when she lighted the fuse to blow up our good
warship. It was a fool&#8217;s trick that we&#8217;ll make Spain pay
dearly for yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So it&#8217;s just for revenge, then, for the Maine horror.
Thaine, think how many times worse than that this war
might be. Isn&#8217;t there any way to punish Spain except by
sending more Americans to be killed by her fuses and her
guns?&#8221; Leigh insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is more than the <i>Maine</i> affair,&#8221; Thaine assured
her. &#8220;You know, just off our coast, almost in sight of
our guns, Spain has held Cuba for all these centuries in
a bondage of degradation and ignorance and cruel oppression.
You know there has been an awful warfare going
on there for three years between the Spanish government
and the rebels against it. And that for a year and a half
the atrocities of Weyler, the Captain General of the Spanish
forces, make an unprintable record. The United States
has declared war, not to retaliate for the loss of the
<i>Maine</i> alone, awful as it was, but to right wrongs too long
neglected, to put a twentieth century civilization instead of
a sixteenth century barbarity in Cuba.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine was reciting his lesson glibly, but Leigh broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;But why must you go? You, an only child?&#8221;</p>
<p>She had never seen a soldier. Her knowledge of warfare
had been given her by the stories Jim Shirley and Dr.
Carey had told to her in her childhood.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really not my fault that I&#8217;m an only child. It&#8217;s
an inheritance. My father was an only child, too. He
went to war at the mature age of fifteen. I&#8217;ll be twenty-one
betimes.&#8221; Thaine stood up with military stiffness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your father fought to save his country. You just
want gold lace and a lark. War is no frolic, Thaine
Aydelot,&#8221; Leigh insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not counting on a frolic, Miss Shirley, and I don&#8217;t
want any gold lace till I have earned it,&#8221; Thaine declared
proudly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why do you go?&#8221; Leigh queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;I go in the name of patriotism. Wars don&#8217;t just
happen. At least, that is what the professor at the University
tells us. Back of this Spanish fuss is a bigger
turn waiting than has been foretold. Watch and see if I
am not a prophet. This is a war to right human wrongs.
That&#8217;s why we are going into it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But your father wants you here. The Sunflower
Ranch is waiting for you,&#8221; Leigh urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;His father wanted him to stay in Ohio, so our family
history runs. But Mr. Asher heard the calling of the
prairies. His wilderness lay on the Kansas plains, and he
came out and drove back the frontier line and pretty near
won it. At least, he&#8217;s got a wheat crop in this year that
looks some like success.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine smiled, but Leigh&#8217;s face was grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leighlie, my frontier is where the Spanish yoke
hangs heavy on the necks of slaves. I must go and win it.
I must drive back my frontier line where I find it, not where
my grandfather found it. I must do a man&#8217;s part in the
world&#8217;s work.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>His voice was full of earnestness and his dark eyes were
glowing with the fire of inspiration. By the patriotism
and enthusiasm of the youth of twenty-one has victory
come to many a battlefield.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I don&#8217;t want you to go away to war,&#8221; Leigh
pleaded.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t want me here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine let his hand rest gently on hers for a moment
as it lay on top of the easel; then hastily withdrew it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Has your alfalfa struck root deep enough to begin
to pull up that mortgage yet?&#8221; he inquired, as if to drop
the unpleasant subject.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; Leigh answered. &#8220;We make every acre help
to seed more acres. It&#8217;s an uphill pull. It&#8217;s my war with
Spain, you know. But I&#8217;m doing something with these
little daubs of mine. I have sold a few pieces. The price
wasn&#8217;t large, but it was something to put against a hungry
interest account. Some day I want to paint&mdash;&#8221;she hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Thaine asked.</p>
<p>Leigh was bending over her brushes and paints, and did
not look up as she said with an effort at indifference:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the Purple Notches. It is so beautiful over
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine bit his lips to hold back the words, and Leigh
went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Carey says Uncle Jim couldn&#8217;t have held out long
at general farming. But the Coburn book was right. The
alfalfa is the silent subsoiler, and when the whole quarter
is seeded we&#8217;ll pull that mortgage up by the roots, all
right.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>She looked up with shining eyes, and Thaine took both
of her hands in his, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;I must tell you good-by now. Mother will know I am
here and will be dragging the lake for me. This isn&#8217;t like
other good-bys. Of course, I may come back a Brigadier
General and make you very proud of me, or I might not
come at all, but I won&#8217;t say that. Oh, Leigh, Leigh, may
I tell you once more how dear you are to me? Will you
promise again to send me the same message you sent to
Prince Quippi when you want me to come back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will,&#8221; Leigh replied in a low voice, and for that
moment the grove became for them a holy sanctuary,
wherein their words were sacred vows.</p>
<p>When Thaine reached home again, Dr. Carey was just
leaving, and the way was prepared for the purpose of his
own coming, as he had hoped it would be.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a call to make across the river. I&#8217;ll be back in
time to take you up to catch the train. There&#8217;s a feast
of a breakfast waiting in there for you. I know, for I
had my share of it. Good-by for an hour or two.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor waved his hand to Thaine and drove away.</p>
<p>&#8220;So the wanderlust and spirit of adventure in the
Aydelot blood got you after all,&#8221; Asher Aydelot said as
he looked across the breakfast table at his son. &#8220;It seems
such a little while ago that I was a boy in Ohio, a foolish
fifteen-year-old, crazy to see and be into what I&#8217;ve wished
so often since that I could forget.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you don&#8217;t object, Father?&#8221; Thaine asked eagerly.</p>
<p>Asher did not reply at once. A rush of boyhood memories
flooded his mind, and as he looked at Virginia he
recalled how his mother had looked at him on the day he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
left home to join the Third Ohio regiment nearly forty
years ago. And then he remembered the moonlit night and
his mother&#8217;s blessing when he told of his longing for the
open West, where opportunity hunts the man.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Thaine,&#8221; he answered gently at last. &#8220;All I ask
is that you try to foresee what is coming in hardship and
responsibility. Young men go to war for adventure mostly.
The army life may make a hero of you, not by brevet nor
always by official record, but a hero nevertheless in bravery
where courage is needed, and in a sense of duty done. Or
it can make a low-grade scoundrel of you almost before
you know it, if you do not put yourself on guard duty over
yourself twenty-four hours out of every twenty-four. War
means real hardship. It is in everything the opposite of
peace. And this war foreshadows big events. It may lead
you to Cuba or to the Orient. Our Asiatic squadron is
ordered from Hong Kong. Dr. Carey tells me it is going
to meet the Spanish navy in the Philippines. I thought
I fixed the West when I came here as a scout and later a
settler, and drove the frontier back with my rifle and my
hoe. Is it possible your frontier is further westward still?
Even across the Pacific Ocean, where another kind of
wilderness lies?&#8221;</p>
<p>Into Asher&#8217;s clear gray eyes, that for all the years had
held the vision of the wide, pathless prairies redeemed to
fruitfulness, there was a vision now of the big things with
which the twentieth century must cope. The work of a
generation younger than his own.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget two things, Thaine, when you are fairly
started in this campaign. First, that wars do not last
forever. They jar the frontier line back by leaps, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
after war is over the good old prairie soil is waiting still
for you&mdash;acres and acres yet unredeemed. And secondly,
while you are a soldier don&#8217;t waste energy with memories.
Fight when you wear a uniform, and dream and remember
when the guns are cold. You have my blessing, Thaine,
only remember the blessing of Moses to Asher of old, &#8216;As
your day so will your strength be.&#8217; But you must have
your mother&#8217;s approval too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine looked lovingly at his mother, and the picture
of her fine face lighted by eyes full of mother love staid
with him through all the months that followed. And all
the old family pride of the Thaines of Virginia, all the old
sense of control and daring was in her tone as she answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;You have come to a man&#8217;s estate. You must choose
for yourself. But big as the world is, it is too little for
mothers to be lost in. You cannot find a frontier so far
that a mother&#8217;s love has not outrun you to it. Go out and
win.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a Trojan, mother. I hope I&#8217;ll always be
worthy of your love, wherever I am,&#8221; her son murmured.</p>
<p>Two hours later, when Dr. Carey stopped for Thaine,
Virginia Aydelot came down to his buggy. Her face was
very white and her eyes were shining with heroic resolve
to be brave to the last.</p>
<p>&#8220;Horace, you may be glad you have no children,&#8221; she
said, as they waited for Thaine and his father to come out.</p>
<p>&#8220;My life has had many opportunities for service that
must make up for the lack of other blessings. It may
have further opportunity soon. May I ask a favor of
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia was not to blame that her heart was too full to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
catch the undertone of sorrow in Horace Carey&#8217;s words as
she replied graciously:</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything that I can grant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Life is rather uncertain&mdash;even with a good doctor in
the community&mdash;&#8221;Dr. Carey&#8217;s smile was always winning.
&#8220;I have hoarded less than I should have done if there had
been a Carey to follow me. There will be nobody but Bo
Peep to miss me, especially after awhile. I want you to
give him a home if he ever needs one. He has some earnings
to keep him from want. But you and I are the only
Virginians in the valley. Promise me!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I will, always, Horace. Be sure of that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, Virginia. I am planning to start to
California in a few days. I may be gone for several
months. I&#8217;ll tell you good-by now, for I may not be down
this way again before I go.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia remembered afterward the doctor&#8217;s strong handclasp
and the steady gaze of his dark eyes and the pathos
of his voice as he bade her good-by. But she did not note
these then, for at that moment Thaine came down the walk
with his father, and in the sorrow of parting with her son
she had no mind for other things.</p>
<p>Dreary rains filled up the first days of May. At Camp
Leedy, where the Kansas volunteers mobilized on the old
Fair Ground on the outskirts of Topeka, Thaine Aydelot
sat under the shelter of his tent watching the water pouring
down the canvas walls of other tents and overflowing the
deep ruts that cut the grassy sod with long muddy gashes.
Camp Leedy was made up mostly of muddy gashes crossed
by streams of semi-liquid mud supposed to be roads.
Thaine sat on a pile of sodden straw. His clothing was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
muddy, his feet were wet, and the chill of the cold rain
made him shiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Noble warfare, this!&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;Asher
Aydelot knew his bearing when he told me that war was
no ways like peace. I wonder what&#8217;s going on right now
down at the Sunflower Ranch. The rain ought to fill that
old spillway draw from the lake down in the woods. It&#8217;s
nearly time for the water lilies to bloom, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The memory of the May night two years before with
Leigh Shirley, all pink and white and sweet and modest,
came surging across his mind as a heavy dash of rain
deluged the tent walls about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Private Thaine Aydelot, Twentieth Kansas
Volunteers, if you are going to be a soldier stop that
memory business right here, except to remember what Private
Asher Aydelot, of the Third Ohio Infantry, told you
about guard duty twenty-six hours out of twenty-four.
Heigh ho!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine ended with a sigh, then he shut his teeth grimly
and stared at the unceasing downpour with unseeing eyes.</p>
<p>A noisy demonstration in the camp roused him, and in
a minute more young Todd Stewart lay stretched at full
length in the mud before his tent.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome to our city, whose beauties have overcome
others also,&#8221; Thaine said, as he helped Todd to rise from
the mud.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you look good to me, whether I do to you or
not,&#8221; Todd declared, as he scraped at the muddy plaster on
his clothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enter!&#8221; Thaine exclaimed dramatically, holding back
the tent flaps. &#8220;I hope you are not wounded.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span></p>
<p>Todd limped inside and sat down on the wet straw.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my company just got to camp. I was so crazy
to see anybody from the short grass country that I made
a slide your way too swiftly. I don&#8217;t mind these clothes,
for I&#8217;ll be getting my soldier&#8217;s togs in a minute anyhow,
but I did twist that ankle in my zeal. Where&#8217;s your
uniform?&#8221; Todd asked, staring at Thaine&#8217;s clothes.</p>
<p>&#8220;With yours, still. Make a minute of it when you
get it, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; Thaine replied. &#8220;Our common Uncle
wants soldiers. He has no time to give to their clothes.
A ragged shirt or naked breast will stop a Spanish bullet
as well as a khaki suit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to say you haven&#8217;t your soldier uniform
yet?&#8221; Todd broke in.</p>
<p>&#8220;A few of us have, but most of us haven&#8217;t. They cost
something,&#8221; Thaine said with a shiver, for the May afternoon
was chilly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll not stay here and risk my precious life for
a government so darned little and stingy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Todd sprang up with the words, but fell down again,
clasping his ankle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you will. You&#8217;ve enlisted already, and you
have a bad ankle already. Let me see it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine examined the sprained limb carefully. He had
something of his father&#8217;s ability for such things combined
with his mother&#8217;s gentle touch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me bind it up a little while you tell me about
Grass River. Then hie thee to a hospital,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing new, except that Dr. Carey has gone
West for a vacation and John Jacobs is raising cain over
at Wykerton because a hired hand, just a waif of an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
orphan boy, got drunk in Hans Wyker&#8217;s joint and fell
into Big Wolf and was drowned. Funny thing about it
was that Darley Champers came out against Wyker for
the first time. It may go hard with the old Dutchman
yet. Jim Shirley isn&#8217;t very well, but he never complains,
you know. Jo Bennington was wild to have me enlist. I
suppose some pretty University girl was backing you all
the time,&#8221; Todd said enthusiastically.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only pretty girl I care for didn&#8217;t want me to go
to the war at all,&#8221; Thaine replied, staring gloomily out at
the rain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why do you go, then?&#8221; Todd inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she doesn&#8217;t specially care for me here, either,&#8221;
Thaine replied. &#8220;Girls don&#8217;t control this game for me.
But we have some princes of men here all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As for instance?&#8221; Todd queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;My captain, Adna Clarke, and his lieutenants, Krause
and Alford. They were first to enlist in our company down
in the old rink at Lawrence. Captain Clarke is the kind of
a man who makes you feel like straightening right up to
duty when you see him coming, and he is so genial in his
discipline it is not like discipline. Lieutenant Krause fits
in with him&mdash;hand and glove. But, Todd,&#8221; Thaine went
on enthusiastically, &#8220;if you meet a man on this campground
with the face of a gentleman, the manners of a
soldier, a smile like sunshine after a dull day in February,
and a, well a sort of air about him that makes you feel he&#8217;s
your friend and that doing a kind act is the only thing a
fellow should ever think of doing&mdash;that&#8217;s Lieutenant
Alford. There are some fine University boys here and we
have all packed up our old Kansas University yell, &#8216;Rock
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
Chalk! Jay Hawk! K U!&#8217; to use on the Spanish. We&#8217;ll
make them learn to run whenever they hear that yell. The
whole regiment is a credit to Kansas, if we haven&#8217;t the
clothes right now. You are rather a disreputable looking
old mudball yourself. Let&#8217;s try to get to the hospital
tent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine lifted Todd Stewart to his feet, and as they
started up the slushy way to the hospital tent, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yonder is Lieutenant Alford now.&#8221;</p>
<p>A young man with a face as genial as his manner was
dignified responded pleasantly to the private&#8217;s salute, and
the rainfall seemed less dreary and all the camp more cheerful
for this lieutenant&#8217;s presence. No wonder he seemed
a prince to the enthusiastic young soldier whose admiration
deepened into an abiding love he was never to lose out of
his life in all the years to come. In the months that followed
Thaine came to know Captain Clarke and his two
lieutenants, Krause and Alford, as soldier knows soldier.
Nor did ever Trojan nor Roman military hero have truer
homage from the common private than the boy from the
Grass River Valley paid to these young men commanding
his company.</p>
<p>The hardships of soldier life began for Thaine Aydelot
and his regiment with the day of enlistment. The privations
at Camp Leedy were many. The volunteers had
come in meagerly clothed because they expected to be fully
supplied by the government they were to serve. The camp
equipments were insufficient. The food was poor, and day
after day the rain poured mercilessly down on the muddy
campground, where the volunteers slept on wet straw piled
on the wet earth. Sore throats, colds, and pneumonia
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
resulted, and many a homesick boy who learned to wade the
rice swamps and to face the Mauser&#8217;s bullets fearlessly had
his first hard lesson of endurance taught to him before he
left Camp Leedy on the old Topeka Fair Ground.</p>
<p>Wonderful history-making filled up the May days.
While the fleets and land forces were moving against Cuba,
the deep sea cable brought the brief story from Commodore
Dewey in the harbor of Manila, &#8220;Eleven Spanish warships
destroyed and no Americans killed.&#8221;</p>
<p>And suddenly the center of interest shifted from the
Cuban Island near at hand to the Philippines on the other
side of the world. The front door of America that for
four centuries had opened on the Atlantic ocean opened
once and forever on Pacific waters. A new frontier receding
ever before the footprint of the Anglo-American flung
itself about the far-off island of the Orient with its old
alluring call:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Something lost behind the Ranges!</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Over Yonder! Go you there!</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>And the Twentieth Kansas, under Colonel Fred Funston,
broke camp and hurried to San Francisco to be ready to
answer that call.</p>
<p>Thaine Aydelot had never been outside of Kansas before.
Small wonder that the mountains, the desert, the vinelands,
and orchard-lands, and rose-lands of California, the half-orientalism
of San Francisco and the Pacific Ocean with its
world-old mystery of untamed immensity should fill each
day with a newer interest; or that the conditions of soldier
life at Camp Merritt beside the Golden Gate, to which the
eager-hearted, untrained young student from the Kansas
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
prairie brought all his youthful enthusiasm and patriotism
and love of adventure, should wound his spirit and test his
power of self-control. Small wonder, too, that the Twentieth
Kansas Regiment, poorly equipped, undrilled, and
non-uniformed still, should make only a sorry showing
among the splendid regiments mobilized there; or that to
the big, rich City of San Francisco the ragged fellows from
the prairies, who were dubbed the &#8220;Kansas Scarecrows,&#8221;
should become the byword and laughing stock among things
military.</p>
<p>One neglect followed another for the Kansas Twentieth.
The poorest camping spot was their portion. The chill
of the nights, the heat of the days oppressed them. The
filth of their unsanitary grounds bred discomfort and disease.</p>
<p>But no military favors were shown them, and the
same old stupid jests and jibes of the ignorant citizen of
the other states were repeated on the Pacific seaboard.
When the thirtieth of May called forth the military forces
in one grand parade the Twentieth Kansas was not invited
to take part.</p>
<p>For Thaine Aydelot, to whom Decoration Day was a
sacred Sabbath always, this greatest of all indignities cut
deep where a man&#8217;s soul feels keenest. And when transport
after transport sailed out of the San Francisco harbor,
loaded with regiments for the Philippines, and still the
Twentieth Kansas was left in idle waiting on the dreary
sand lots of Camp Merritt and the Presidio reservation, the
silent campaign that really makes a soldier was waged
daily in Thaine and his comrades.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t complain, boys,&#8221; Captain Clarke admonished his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
company. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be ready when we are called, and that&#8217;s
what really counts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Other commanders of the regiment gave the same encouragement.
So the daily drilling went on. The sons of the
indomitable men and women who had conquered the border
ruffian, the hostile Plains Indian, and the unfriendly prairie
sod, these sons kept their faith in themselves, their pride
in the old Kansas State that bore them, and their everlasting
good humor and energy and ability to learn. Such men
are the salt of the earth.</p>
<p>Todd Stewart made a brave struggle, but his slide on
the muddy ground at Camp Leedy was his military undoing,
and his discharge followed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to start back to old Grass River tomorrow,&#8221;
he said to Thaine Aydelot, who had called to see him with
face aglow. &#8220;I&#8217;ve made the best fight I could, but the
doctor says the infantry needs two legs, and neither one
wooden. But best of all, Thaine, Jo has written that she
wants me to come home. It&#8217;s not so bad if there&#8217;s a
welcome like that waiting. She is slowly overcoming
her dislike for country life. But I can&#8217;t help envying
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll stand on both feet all right when you get
them both on the short grass of the prairie again, and, as
you say, the welcome makes up for a good many losses.&#8221;</p>
<p>Something impenetrable came into his eyes for the
moment only and then the fire of enthusiasm burned again
in them, for Thaine&#8217;s nerves were a-tingle with the ambition
and anticipation of the young soldier waiting immediate
orders, and he changed the subject eagerly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I came to tell you something, Todd. We are to sail
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
the seas on the next transport to Manila, sure. And we&#8217;ll
see service yet, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine threw his cap in air and danced about the bed
in his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory be! Won&#8217;t Fred Funston do things when he
hits the Orient? Best colonel that ever had the U. S.
military engines to buck against.&#8221;</p>
<p>Todd rejoiced, even in his own disappointment.</p>
<p>&#8220;But see here, Thaine, me child, I also have a bit of
news that may interest you plumb through. My surgeon
isn&#8217;t equal to the Philippines either, nor the Ephesians, nor
Colossians, and he&#8217;s going back to some fort in the mountains.
Who do you s&#8217;pose will take his place? Now,
who?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How should I know? Seeing I&#8217;ve got to get this regiment
off, I have to leave the hospital corps to you. Who
is it?&#8221; Thaine asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Horace Carey, M.D.!&#8221; Todd replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean it!&#8221; Thaine gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he does, Thaine.&#8221; It was Horace Carey who
spoke, as he entered the hospital quarter, and, as everywhere
else, the same engaging smile and magnetic charm of personality
filled the place.</p>
<p>Thaine turned and gathered him in close embrace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Dr. Carey, are you really going?&#8221; He whistled,
and shouted, and executed jigs in his joy. &#8220;Why do you
go? Can you leave Kansas? You and me both? Oh,
hurry home, Todd, and show Governor Leedy how to run
things without us.&#8221; And much more to like effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve a notion I&#8217;m the right man to go,&#8221; Horace Carey
answered. &#8220;I had experience in the late Civil War, which
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
seems trifling to you fellows at the Presidio. I rode the
Plains for some years more when rattlesnakes and Indian
arrows&mdash;poisoned at that&mdash;and cholera and mountain
fever called for a surgeon&#8217;s aid. I have diplomas and things
from the best schools in the East. I have also some good
military friends in authority to back me in getting a
surgeon&#8217;s place in the army&mdash;and, lastly, I haven&#8217;t a soul
to miss me, nor home to leave dreary, if I get between
you and the enemy; nobody but Boanerges Peeperville to
care personally, and Mrs. Aydelot, as the only other aristocrat
in the Grass River Valley, has promised to give him
a home. He has always adored Virginia, Thaine, since he
could remember anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine Aydelot was only twenty-one, with little need
hitherto for experience in reading human nature. Moreover,
he was alert in every tingling nerve with the anticipation
of an ocean voyage and of strange new sights and
daring deeds half a world away. Yet something in Dr.
Carey&#8217;s strong face seemed to imply a deeper purpose than
his words suggested. A faint sense of the nobility of the
man gripped him and grew upon him, and never in the
years that followed was separate from the memory of the
doctor he had loved from babyhood.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When the Ohio woodlands were gorgeous with the frost-fired
splendor of October word came to Miss Jane Aydelot,
of the old Aydelot farmhouse beside the National pike road,
that one Thaine Aydelot had sailed from San Francisco
with the Twentieth Kansas Regiment to see service in the
Philippine Islands. On board the same transport was Dr.
Horace Carey, of the military medical staff. That winter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
Jane Aydelot&#8217;s hair turned white, but the pink bloom of
her cheeks and the light of her clear gray eyes made her
a sweet-faced woman still, whose loveliness grew with the
years.</p>
<p>The kiss of the same October breezes was on the Kansas
prairie with the hazy horizon and the infinite beauty of
wide, level landscapes, overhung by the infinite beauty of
blue, tender skies. Boanerges Peeperville, established as
cook in the Sunflower Inn, was at home in his cosy little
quarter beside the grape arbor of the rear dooryard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me, Bo Peep, why Dr. Carey should enter the
army again and go to the Philippines?&#8221; Virginia
Aydelot asked on the day the news reached the Sunflower
Ranch.</p>
<p>Bo Peep did not answer at once. Virginia was busy
arranging some big yellow chrysanthemums in a tall cut-glass
vase that Dr. Carey had left to be sent down to her
when Bo Peep should come to the Aydelots to make his
home.</p>
<p>&#8220;See, Bo Peep, aren&#8217;t they pretty? Set them in the
middle of the table there, carefully. The first bouquet we
ever had on our table was a few little sunflowers in an old
peach can wrapped round with a newspaper. You didn&#8217;t
answer my question. Why did Horace go so far away?&#8221;</p>
<p>The servant took the vase carefully and placed it as
commanded. Then he turned to Virginia with a face full
of intense feeling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Virgie, I done carry messages for him all my
days.&#8221; The pathos of the soft voice was touching. &#8220;I
wasn&#8217;t to give this las&#8217; one to you less&#8217;n he neveh come
back. An Mis&#8217; Virgie, Doctoh Carey won&#8217;t neveh come
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
back no mo&#8217;. But I kaint tell you yet jus&#8217; why he done
taken hisself to the Fillippians, not yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you think he will never come back? You
think Thaine will come home again, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; Virginia
queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yas&#8217;m! yas&#8217;m! Misteh Thaine, he&#8217;ll come back all
right. But hit&#8217;s done fo&#8217;casted in my bones that Doctoh
Horace won&#8217;t neveh come. An&#8217; when he don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll tell you
why he leff&#8217;n Grass Riveh, Kansas, for the Fillippians.&#8221;</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Night had fallen on the city of Manila. Before it
lay the bay whose waters lapped softly against pier
and shipping. Behind it in the great arc of a circle
stretched the American line of military outposts, guarded
by sentinels. Beyond that line, north, east, and south, there
radiated a tangle of roads and trails through little villages
of nipa huts, past rice fields and jungles, marshes and
rivers, into the very heart of Luzon. Manila was under
American military government, but Luzon was in insurrection
against all government, and a network of rebellious
lines of enemies fretted every jungle, hid in every village,
intrenched itself in every rice field, and banked its earthworks
beyond every river. While Emilio Aguinaldo, the
shrewd leader of an ignorant, half-savage peasantry,
plotted craftily with his associates for the seizure of the
rich capital of Luzon and dreamed of the autocratic power
and heaps of looted treasure that he should soon control.
For weeks in sight of the American outposts, the Filipinos
had strengthened their trenches, and established their
fortifications, the while they bided the hour of outbreak
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
and slaughter of the despised Americanos, and the seizing
of the rich booty afterward.</p>
<p>Upon the Tondo road, running north from Manila to
Caloocan, Thaine Aydelot, with a Kansas University comrade,
was doing silent sentinel duty. The outpost was
nearly a mile away from a bridge on the outskirts of
Manila. In the attack imminent, this bridge would be one
of the keys to the city, and the command had been given
to hold it against all invaders at any cost.</p>
<p>Between Thaine and the bridge was a stretch of dusty
road, flanked on one side by nipa huts. On the other side
were scattered dwellings, tall shrubbery, and low-lying
rice fields, beyond which lay the jungle.</p>
<p>Before the young sentinel the road made a sharp bend,
cutting off the view and giving no hint to the enemy around
this bend of how strong a force might be filling the road
toward the bridge.</p>
<p>Thaine knew that around that bend and behind the rice
dykes and in the nearby trenches were Filipino insurgents
with finger on the trigger ready to begin an assault. But
until the first gun of the first battle is fired, battle seems
impossible to the young soldier.</p>
<p>As Thaine turned from the dim road, he caught the
glint of starlight on the edge of a rice swamp. He wanted
to fight Filipinos tonight, not memories. But the memory
of the Aydelot grove and the water lilies opening their
creamy hearts to the moonlight, and Leigh Shirley in her
white dress with her cheeks faintly pink in the clear
shadows, all swept his mind and challenged him to forget
everything else.</p>
<p>The same grip on a principle, coupled with a daring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
spirit and love of adventure that had brought old Jean
Aydelot to the Virginia colony long ago, and had pushed
Francis Aydelot across the Alleghanies into the forests of
the Ohio frontier, and had called Asher Aydelot to the
unconquered prairies of the big West&mdash;the same love of
adventure and daring spirit and belief in a cause bigger
than his own interests had lured Thaine Aydelot on to
the islands of Oriental seas. With the military schooling
and unschooling where discipline tends to make a soldier,
and absence of home influence tends to make the careless
rowdy, the sterling uprightness of the Aydelots and the
inborn gentility of the Thaines kept the boy from the Kansas
prairies a fearless gentleman. Withal, he was exuberantly
pleased with life, as a young man of twenty-one
should be. He lived mostly in the company of Kansas
University men, and with the old University yell of &#8220;Rock
Chalk! Jay Hawk! K U!&#8221; for their slogan, they stood
shoulder to shoulder in every conflict.</p>
<p>Lastly, he was a hero-worshiper at the shrine of his
colonel, Fred Funston, and his captain, Adna Clarke;
while in all the regiment, the fair face of young Lieutenant
Alford seemed to him most gracious. Alford was his soldier
ideal, type of the best the battlefield may know. And,
even if all this admiration did have in it much of youthful
sentimentalism, it took nothing from his efficiency when he
came to his place on the firing line.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder where Doctor Carey is tonight,&#8221; Thaine&#8217;s
comrade said in a low voice, as the two came together in
the road.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s made you think of him?&#8221; Thaine asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen him since Christmas day. A young
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
Filipino and I got into a scrap with a drunken Chinaman
who was beating a boy, and the Chink slashed us both.
Carey stitched us up, but the other fellow keeps a scar
across his face, all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that Filipino,&#8221; Thaine said. &#8220;He seems like
a fine young man. The scar was a marker for him. I&#8217;d
know him by it anywhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So should I, and by his peculiar gait. I saw a man
slipping along beyond the lines just now who made me
think of that fellow, and that made me think of Doctor
Carey,&#8221; the sentinel said, and turned away.</p>
<p>It was after nine o&#8217;clock, and the hours were already
beginning to stretch wearily for sentinels, when a faint
sound of guns away to the eastward broke on the air.
Again and again it came, intermittently at first, but increasing
to a steady roar. Down in Manila there was
dead quiet, but along the American line of outposts the
ripping of Mauser bullets and long streaks of light flashed
the Filipino challenge to war in steady volleys.</p>
<p>As Thaine listened, the firing seemed to be creeping
gradually toward the north, and he knew the insurgents
were swinging toward the Tondo road, down which they
would rush to storm the bridge. In that moment civil
life dropped off like a garment, and he stood up a soldier.
He crept cautiously toward the bend to see what lay
beyond, and dropped on his face in the dusty way as a
whirl of bullets split the air above his head.</p>
<p>As he sprang back to his place beside his comrade, other
sentinels joined them, and behind them loomed the tall form
of Captain Clarke.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s around there, Aydelot?&#8221; Clarke asked.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine&#8217;s reply was lost in a roar of rifles, followed by
increased firing along the entire line, massing to the north
before the Twentieth&#8217;s front.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are ten more men on the way up here. We&#8217;ll
hold this place until reinforcements come,&#8221; Captain Clarke
declared.</p>
<p>It was such a strategic point as sometimes turns the
history of war. But the odds are heavy for sixteen men
to stand against swarms of insurgents armed with Mausers
and Remingtons. In the thrill of that moment, Thaine
Aydelot would have died by inches had this tall, cool-headed
captain of his demanded it. Clarke arranged his men on
either side of the way, and the return fire began. Suddenly
up the road a lantern gleamed. An instant later a cannon
shot plowed the dust between the two lines of men.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve turned a cannon loose. Watch out,&#8221; Clarke
called through the darkness.</p>
<p>A second time and a third the lantern glowed, and each
time a cannon ball crashed through a nipa hut beside the
little company, or threw a shower of dust about the place.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have to load that gun by the light of a lantern.
Let&#8217;s fix the lantern,&#8221; Thaine cried, as the dust cloud settled
down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Watch your aim, boys,&#8221; Captain Clarke
replied.</p>
<p>The bullets were falling thick about them. They whizzed
through the bushes, they cut into the thatched huts, they
flung swirls of dust on the little line of brave soldiers,
they poured like stinging sweeps of hail, volley after volley,
along the Tondo road. When the lantern flashed again,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span>
sixteen bullets riddled it, and without its help the big gun
was useless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor lantern! It fell on the firing line, brave to the
last,&#8221; Thaine declared as the smoke lifted.</p>
<p>But the loss of the cannon only doubled the insurgents&#8217;
efforts, and they threshed at the invincible little band with
smoking lead. On the one side was a host of Filipino
rebels, believing by the incessant firing of the Kansans that
it was facing an equal host. On the other side were sixteen
men who, knowing the odds against them, dared the game
of war to the limit.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many rounds have you left?&#8221; Captain Clarke
asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only one,&#8221; came the answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give it to them when I give the word. We won&#8217;t run
till our guns are empty,&#8221; the captain declared grimly.</p>
<p>The last shot was ready to fly, when a wild yell burst
from the darkness behind them, the shouts to &#8220;remember
the <i>Maine</i>,&#8221; mingled with the old university yell of &#8220;Rock
Chalk, Jay Hawk, K. U. oo!&#8221; and reinforcements charged
to the relief of the invincible sixteen.</p>
<p>What disaster might have followed the capture of the
Tondo road and the attack upon the bridge is only conjecture.
What did happen is history&mdash;type henceforth
of that line of history every company of the Twentieth
Kansas was to help to build. When daylight came, Thaine
Aydelot saw the frontier line that he had proudly felt himself
called hither to push back, and the reality of it was
awful. He had pictured captured trenches, but he had not
put in their decoration&mdash;the prone forms of dead Filipinos
with staring eyes, seeing nothing earthly any more forever.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>Beyond that line, however, lay the new wilderness that
the Anglo-American must conquer, and he flung himself
upon the firing line, as if the safety and honor of the
American nation rested on his shoulders alone; while all
his dreams of glorious warfare, where Greek meets Greek
in splendid gallantry, faded out before the actual warfare
of the days and nights that followed.</p>
<p>Thaine&#8217;s regiment, not the &#8220;Kansas Scarecrows,&#8221; but
the &#8220;Fighting Twentieth&#8221; now, was one of the regiments
on which rested the brunt of driving back and subduing
the rebellious Filipinos. Swiftly the Kansas boys pushed
into the unknown country north of Manila. They rushed
across the rice fields, whose low dykes gave little protection
from the enemy. They plunged through marshes, waist
deep in water. They lay for hours behind their earthworks,
half buried in muddy slime. They slept in holes, drenched
to the skin. With the University yell for their battle cry
of freedom, they tore through tropical jungles with the
bullets of the enemy cutting the branches overhead or
spattering the dirt about their feet.</p>
<p>The American regiments were six days in reaching
Caloocan, a prosperous town only six miles north of
Manila; a mile a day, every foot stubbornly contested.</p>
<p>On Sabbath morning in the first day&#8217;s struggle, Thaine
was running in a line of soldiery toward the Filipino fortification,
when he was halted beside a thatched hut that stood
between the guns of both armies and was riddled with
bullets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help the corporal here, Aydelot, then double quick it
ahead,&#8221; Lieutenant Krause commanded.</p>
<p>Thaine followed the corporal inside the hut where, shot
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
to pieces, lay the mangled forms of women and children
who had caught the storm of bullets from both firing lines.
Through a gaping hole in the wall beyond, he saw a shallow
pit where wounded and dead men and women were
huddled together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Help me get out the live ones and send them back
to Manila, and we&#8217;ll cover the others right here,&#8221; the corporal
declared.</p>
<p>It was the neighborhood custom of the Grass River Valley
for young men to assist at every funeral. Thaine had jokingly
dubbed himself &#8220;official neighborhood pall-bearer,&#8221;
and had served at so many funerals that the service had
become merely one of silent dignity which he forgot the
next hour. He knew just how to place the flowers effectively,
when to step aside and wait, and when to come forward
and take hold. And these were the only kinds of
services he had known for the dead.</p>
<p>As he bent over the blood-smeared bodies to take up the
wounded and dying now, the horror of war burst upon him,
and no dead face could be more ashy gray than the young
soldier&#8217;s face as he lifted it above a dying Filipino woman
whom he stretched tenderly beside the hut. The next victim
was a boy, a deserter from Manila, whom Thaine recognized
by a scar across his cheek as the young Filipino whose
wound Doctor Carey had dressed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You poor fellow!&#8221; Thaine said softly.</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s eyes opened in recognition.</p>
<p>&#8220;For liberty,&#8221; he murmured in Spanish, with a scowling
face. Then the scowl faded to a smile, and in a moment
more he had entered eternal liberty.</p>
<p>A detachment of the Red Cross with a white-haired
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
surgeon just then relieved the corporal of the wounded, and
Thaine saw Dr. Horace Carey coming toward him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what you are thinking. Maybe your gun did
a good deal of it. This is war, Thaine.&#8221;</p>
<p>The young man&#8217;s dark eyes burned with agony at the
thought.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget it,&#8221; Carey added hurriedly. &#8220;It is the lost
cause here. I worked that line myself for four years long
ago. I know the feeling. But this is the only medicine to
give the islands here. They can&#8217;t manage liberty for themselves.
You are giving them more freedom with your rifle
today than they could get for themselves in a century. Don&#8217;t
wet your powder with your tears. You may need it for the
devil that&#8217;s after you now. Wait till you see a Kansas
boy brought in and count the cost again. Good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>The doctor hastened away with the wounded, and Thaine
helped to straighten out the forms about him and to fill
the pit where they were placed in one common grave.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till you see a Kansas boy brought in and then
count the cost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Somehow, the words, ringing again and again down
his mind, could not take away the picture of the thing
he had just witnessed. And the dying gasp, &#8220;For liberty!&#8221;
seemed to stab his soul, as he ran forward.</p>
<p>Two days later his company had orders to hold the
trenches before a jungle filled with sharpshooters. All day
the sun had blazed down upon them and the humid atmosphere
had scalded them. All day the murderous &#8220;ping!
ping!&#8221; of the hidden Mauser in the jungle had stung the
air about them.</p>
<p>Late in the afternoon Thaine lay crouched behind his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
low defense with a college comrade on either side. Colonel
Funston had just given the command to rid the woods of
the sharpshooters, and the force ordered to the attack came
racing by. Captain Clarke stood near Thaine&#8217;s post, and
as the soldiers rushed forward, Lieutenant Alford halted
beside him. Even in the thrill of the hour, the private
down in the trenches felt a sense of bigger manhood as he
looked at the young officer, for Alford was every inch a
king; his soldier uniform became him like a robe of royalty.
His fine face was aglow now with the enthusiasm of the
battle and the assurance of victory.</p>
<p>Thaine did not hear the words of the two officers, for
the jungle was beginning to roar with battle cries and
bursting fire from many guns. But he knew the two had
been boyhood friends, university chums, and military comrades,
and the love of man for man shone in their faces.</p>
<p>Alford tarried but a moment with Clarke. As he spied
Thaine and his comrades, he gave an instant&#8217;s glance of
kindly recognition to the admiring young privates, and
was gone. The three involuntarily rose to their feet, as if
to follow him, and from three lusty throats they sent after
him the beloved battle yell of the regiment, &#8220;Rock Chalk!
Jay Hawk! K. U.!&#8221; then dropped to their places again
and hugged the earth as the rifle balls whizzed about them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m alive and I&#8217;m glad I know that man,&#8221;
Thaine said to his neighbors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alford&#8217;s a prince. I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;ll clean that woods before
he&#8217;s through. His work is always well done. Would you
listen to that?&#8221; his comrade replied.</p>
<p>A tremendous crash of rifle shots seemed to split the
jungle as the Kansas troops charged into it. The men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span>
in the trenches lay flat to the earth while the balls fell about
them or sang a long whining note through the air over
them. Fiercer grew the fray, and louder roared the guns,
and wilder the bullets flew, as the fighting lines swept over
the enemy&#8217;s earthworks and struck with deadly force into
the heart of its wooded cover.</p>
<p>Then came a lull for shifting the fighting grip. A relief
force was hurried to the front and the first companies
retired for a brief rest. They fell back in order, while the
aids came trooping out of the brush in groups, bearing the
wounded to places of shelter. Thaine Aydelot and his
comrades lifted their heads above the earthworks for an
instant. Captain Clarke sat near on a little knoll staring
hard at a stretcher borne toward him by the aids. The
manner of covering indicated a dead body on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;How different the captain&#8217;s face is from what it was
before the attack,&#8221; Thaine thought, as he recalled the
moment when Clarke had talked with Lieutenant Alford.
And then the image of the young lieutenant&#8217;s face, so full
of life and hope and power and gentleness, swept vividly
across his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it, boys?&#8221; Clarke called to the soldiers with the
stretcher.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Alford,&#8221; they answered.</p>
<p>Something black dropped before Thaine Aydelot&#8217;s eyes
and Doctor Carey&#8217;s words stung like powder burns in his
memory.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till you see a Kansas boy brought in, and count
the cost again.&#8221;</p>
<p>In civil life character builds slowly up to higher levels.
In war, it leaps upward in an instant. Thaine sprang to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
his feet and stood up to his full height in the blaze of the
tropical sunshine. He did not see his captain, who had
dropped to the ground like a wounded thing, stabbed to
the soul with an agony of sorrow. He did not see the still
form of the young lieutenant outlined under the cover of
the stretcher. He did not see the trenches nor the lines of
khaki-clad, sun-browned soldiery plunging forward to rid
the jungle of its deadly peril. In that one moment he
looked down the years with clear vision, as his father, Asher
Aydelot, had learned to look before him, and he saw manhood
and a new worth in human deeds. He had been a
sentimental dreamer, ambitious for honors fairly earned,
and eager for adventure. The first shots in the night
attack on the Tondo road made him a soldier. The martyrdom
of Lieutenant Alford made him a patriot. Humanity
must be worth much, it seemed to him, if, in the providence
of God, such blood must be spilled to redeem it to
nobler civilization.</p>
<p>Six weeks after the death of Alford before Caloocan,
Dr. Horace Carey came up from the hospital in Manila to
the American line to see Thaine Aydelot. The Kansas boys
had been on duty in the trenches north of Caloocan for
forty days, living beside the breastworks under the rude
shelter of bamboo poles, watching a sleepless enemy&mdash;a
life as full of wearing monotony and hardship as it was
full of constant peril.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Thaine, how goes the game?&#8221; Carey asked, as
he sat beside the young soldier from the Grass River Valley.
&#8220;I helped you into this world. I&#8217;m glad I haven&#8217;t had to
help you out yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carey had never before seen any resemblance to Asher
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span>
Aydelot in his son&#8217;s face. It was purely a type of the old
Thaine family of Virginia. But today, the pose of the
head, the expression of the mouth, the far-seeing gaze of
the dark eyes, bespoke the heritage of the house of Aydelot.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not to have any more help from you, either.
You got me into the scrape; I&#8217;ll see to the rest,&#8221; Thaine
replied. &#8220;Don&#8217;t I look all right? I haven&#8217;t had a bath,
except in swamp mud, since the first of February. Today
is the twenty-third of March. Neither have I seen a razor.
Notice my silky beard. Nor a dress suit, nor a&mdash;anything
else civilized. Six weeks in one hole, killing Filipinos
for our amusement and dodging their old Remingtons for
theirs, living on army rations and respect for the flag of
my country, may not improve my appearance, but it hasn&#8217;t
started me to the sick-shack yet. Any news from home?&#8221;
Thaine ended with the question put so carelessly, with a face
so impenetrable that Doctor Carey took notice at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;Homesick!&#8221; was his mental diagnosis, but he answered
with equal carelessness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I had a letter from Leigh Shirley.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine&#8217;s eyes were too full of unspeakable things now
for him to hold out.</p>
<p>&#8220;She says the alfalfa is doing well. She and Jim have
kept up all the interest, and are beginning to reduce the
principal. That&#8217;s why she wrote.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Brave little soldier,&#8221; Thaine muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, civil life has its heroes, too,&#8221; the doctor responded.
&#8220;She also says,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that John Jacobs has had
Hans Wyker convicted of running a joint and Hans had
to pay a fine and stick in the Careyville jail thirty days.
Hans won&#8217;t love John for that when he gets out.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What a hater of whisky John Jacobs is. He&#8217;s always
on the firing line and never misses his aim, bless him!&#8221;
Thaine declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Jacobs&#8217; battle is a steady one. He told me just
before I left Kansas how his mother was killed in a saloon
in Cincinnati when she was trying to get his father out of
it. John wouldn&#8217;t live in a state that had no prohibitory
law,&#8221; the doctor commented.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did Leigh write anything else?&#8221; Thaine asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Jo Bennington and Todd Stewart are married.
Pryor Gaines is in Pekin, and he writes that there are
rumblings of trouble over there. Shall we go over and
settle it when we finish the Filipino fuss?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Might as well. I&#8217;d like to see old Pryor. I&#8217;m glad
Todd and Jo had sense enough to take each other. I suppose
Jo overcame her notions of living only in the city.
What else?&#8221; Thaine replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing else. That&#8217;s your message.&#8221; Carey&#8217;s black
eyes held a shrewd twinkle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why mine?&#8221; The impenetrable face was on Thaine
again.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here, boy, don&#8217;t think I haven&#8217;t read her story,
page by page. If Leigh had sent you a single line, I&#8217;d
have begun to doubt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine threw one arm about the doctor&#8217;s shoulder and
said not a word. Then Carey read his story also.</p>
<p>&#8220;I nearly forgot to tell you that Leigh is doing well
with her drawings. She sent me this, for which she had a
good price paid her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Carey unfolded the paper back of a magazine
having a bit of prairie landscape for a cover design. In
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
the distance, three headlands swam in the golden haze of
a Kansas October sunset, and their long purple shadows fell
wide across the brown prairie and fields of garnered
harvests.</p>
<p>Thaine studied it carefully, but offered no comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Carey, what brought you to the Philippines?&#8221;
he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&#8220;To look after you,&#8221; Carey replied frankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Me! Do I need it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You may. In that case I&#8217;ll be first aid to the injured,&#8221;
Carey answered. &#8220;I&#8217;m to go with the &#8217;Fighting Twentieth&#8217;
when it starts out of these hog wallows toward the
insurgents&#8217; capital. I must get back to Manila and pack
for it. I have my orders to be ready in twenty-four
hours.&#8221;</p>
<p>In twenty-four hours the &#8220;Fighting Twentieth&#8221; left
its six-weeks&#8217; habitation in the trenches and began its campaign
northward, and the young-hearted, white-haired physician
with magnetic smile and skillful judgment found a
work in army service so broad and useful that he loved it
for its opportunity.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Thaine had no need for &#8220;first aid&#8221; from
Doctor Carey, and he saw the doctor only rarely in the
sixty days that followed. When the two had time for each
other again, Colonel Fred Funston&#8217;s name had been written
round the world in the annals of military achievement, the
resourceful, courageous, beloved leader of a band of fighters
from the Kansas prairies who were never defeated,
never driven back, never daunted by circumstances. Great
were the pen of that historian that could fittingly set forth
all the deeds of daring and acts of humanity of every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
company under every brave captain, for they &#8220;all made history,
and left records of unfading glory.&#8221;</p>
<p>The regiment had reached the Rio Grande, leaving no
unconquered post behind it. Under fire, it had forded the
Tulijan, shoulder-deep to the shorter men. Under fire,
it had forged a way through Guiguinto and Malolos.
Under fire, it had swam the Marilao and the Bagbag. And
now, beyond Calumpit, the flower of Aguinaldo&#8217;s army
was massed under General Luna, north of the Rio Grande.
A network of strong fortifications lay between it and the
river, and it commanded all the wide water-front.</p>
<p>As the soldiers waited orders on the south side of the
river, Doctor Horace Carey left his work and sought
out Thaine&#8217;s company, impelled by the same instinct that
once turned him from the old Sunflower Trail to find Virginia
Aydelot lost on the solitary snow-covered prairie
beyond Little Wolf Creek.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s before you now?&#8221; the doctor asked, as he and
Thaine sat on the ground together.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Rio Grande now. We must be nearly to the end
if we rout General Luna here,&#8221; Thaine replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve stood it well. I guess you don&#8217;t need me after
all,&#8221; Carey remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always need you, Doctor Carey,&#8221; Thaine said earnestly.
&#8220;Never more than now. When I saw Captain
Clarke wounded and carried away on the other side of the
Tulijan, and could only say &#8217;Captain, my captain,&#8217; I
needed you. When Captain Elliot was killed, I needed
you; and when Captain William Watson was shot and
wouldn&#8217;t stay dead because we need him so, and when Metcalf,
Bishop, Agnew, Glasgow, Ramsey, and Martin, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
all the other big-brained fellows do big things, I need you
again. Life is a great game; I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Horace Carey had never before seen Thaine&#8217;s bright face
so alert with manly power and beauty and thoughtfulness.
War had hardened him. Danger had tried him. Human
needs, larger than battle lines alone can know, had
strengthened him. Vision of large purposes had uplifted
him. As he stood before the white-haired physician whom
he had loved from earliest memory, Carey murmured to
himself:</p>
<p>&#8220;Can the world find grander soldiers to fight its battles
than these sun-browned boys from our old Kansas
prairies?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are going across to Luna&#8217;s stronghold in a few
minutes. Watch him go into eclipse before Fred Funston.
If you stand right here, you&#8217;ll see me helping at the job.
Good-by,&#8221; Thaine declared, and, at the bugle call, fell into
his place.</p>
<p>Beyond the river a steady fire was opened on the American
forces, and no bridge nor boat was there by which to
cross. Doctor Carey stood watching the situation with a
strange sense of unrest in his mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be rafts,&#8221; declared Colonel Funston.</p>
<p>And there were rafts, hastily made of bamboo poles.</p>
<p>&#8220;Somebody must swim across and fasten a cable over
there by which to tow the rafts across. Who will volunteer?
You see what&#8217;s before you,&#8221; Funston asserted.</p>
<p>Horace Carey saw two soldiers, Corporal Trembly and
Private Edward White, seize the cable, plunge into the
river, and strike out directly toward the farther side filled
with Filipino forces. Rifle balls split the water about them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
Bullet after bullet cut the air above them. Shot after shot
from the ambushed enemy hurtled toward them. The two
young men surged steadily ahead, bent only on reaching
the bank and fastening the cable. They knew only one
word, duty, and they did the thing they had agreed to
do. Once across the river, they ran nimbly up the bank
and made fast the rope&#8217;s end, while cheer after cheer rose
from their comrades watching them, and the battle cry of
the Fighting Twentieth, &#8220;Rock Chalk, Jay Hawk, K. U.,&#8221;
went pulsing out across the waters of the Rio Grande as
full and strong as in the days when it rolled out on the
university campus on far-away Mount Oread, beside the
Kaw.</p>
<p>The rafts sped along the cable, and squad after squad
went pell mell into General Luna&#8217;s stronghold, under stubborn
fire from the frantic rebels.</p>
<p>Thaine Aydelot was on the last raft to cross the river.
Doctor Carey watched with eager gaze as the last men
reached the farther bank. He saw them scrambling up
from the water&#8217;s edge. He saw Thaine turn back to lift
up a comrade blinded, but not injured, by the smoke of a
gun. He saw the two start forward. Then the faint
&#8220;ping&#8221; of a Mauser came to his ears, and Thaine threw
up his hands and fell backward into the water and sank
from sight, while the other soldiers, unknowing, rushed
forward into battle.</p>
<p>For a moment, Horace Carey stood like a statue, then
he sprang into the river and swam against the fire of the
hidden foe to where Thaine Aydelot had disappeared. Ten
minutes later, while Luna&#8217;s forces were trying vainly to
resist the daring Americans, Thaine Aydelot lay on a raft
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
which Carey, with a Red Cross aid, was pulling toward the
south bank.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>When the Fighting Twentieth soldiers were relieved
from service, and turned their faces gladly toward the
Kansas prairies, whither hundreds of proud fathers and
mothers and wives and sweethearts were waiting to give
eager, happy welcome, Thaine Aydelot lay hovering between
life and death in the hospital at Manila. The
white-haired doctor who had saved him from the waters of
the Rio Grande watched hourly beside him, relying not so
much on the ministrations of his calling as in his trust in
an Infinite Father, through whom at last the sick may be
made whole.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s yo&#8217; letter from the Fillippians, Mis&#8217; Virginia;
Mr. Champers done bring hit for you all.&#8221; Boanerges
Peeperville fairly danced into the living room of the
Sunflower Inn. &#8220;They ain&#8217;t no black mournin&#8217; aidge
bindin&#8217; it round nuthah, thank the good Lawd foh that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Virginia Aydelot opened the letter with trembling fingers.
It was only a brief page, but the message on it was
big with comfort for her.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is from Horace,&#8221; she said, as her eyes followed the
lines. &#8220;He was with Thaine when he wrote it. Thaine is
perfectly well again and busy as ever. He and Horace
seem to be needed over there yet awhile. Isn&#8217;t it wonderful
how Thaine ever lived through that dreadful bullet
wound and fever?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I jus&#8217; wondeh how you all stand up undeh such &#8217;flictions.
Seems to me a motheh done wilt down, but they
don&#8217;t. Mothehs is the bravest things they is,&#8221; Bo Peep
declared with a broad grin of admiration.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we get schooled to it. Asher&#8217;s mother waited
through six years while he was in army service; and remember
how long I waited in Virginia for him to come back
to me! I wondered at the test of my endurance then. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
know now it was to prepare me for Thaine&#8217;s time of service
for his country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I done remember, all right, &#8217;bout that time in ol&#8217; Virginia,
an&#8217; the day I taken you the letteh up in the little
glen behind the ol&#8217; mansion house whah hit wah so cool
and the watah&#8217;s so cleah. Misteh Horace wah home that
day, too. Say, Mis&#8217; Virginia, did&mdash;did he done mention
my name anywhar in that letteh?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pathos of the dark face was pitiful.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;My best love to Bo Peep.&#8217;&#8221; Virginia pointed to the
line as she read.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kin I please have this huh envelope?&#8221; Bo Peep
pleaded, and, clutching it as a sacred treasure, he said:
&#8220;Mis&#8217; Virginia, didn&#8217;t I done tellen you Misteh Thaine
would come back?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you know?&#8221; Virginia asked with shining
eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Becuz of what Doctoh Horace lef for me to tell you.
It cain&#8217;t do no hahm to tell hit thus fah.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bo Peep hesitated, and Virginia looked curiously at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Horace won&#8217;t never come back. I tol&#8217; you that
sufficiency times. When he lef, he say, &#8217;Tel Mis&#8217; Virginia,
if I don&#8217;t come back, I&#8217;se done goin&#8217; to be with
Misteh Thaine an&#8217; take care of him, &#8217;cause I love the boy,&mdash;hit
cain&#8217;t do no hahm to tell you that while Misteh
Horace still writen to us. An&#8217; didn&#8217;t he tak&#8217; care of
Misteh Thaine? Didn&#8217;t he lef his place an&#8217; go down to
that Rigrand Riveh, an&#8217; didn&#8217;t he see Misteh Thaine fall
back with a bullet pushin&#8217; him right into the watah? Yes,
an&#8217; be drownded if Doctoh Horace hadn&#8217;t done swum
right then and fish him out. An&#8217; didn&#8217;t he stay night time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span>
an&#8217; day time right by the blessed boy, till he&#8217;s pullin&#8217; him
out of dangeh of death&#8217;s wing? Oh, yo&#8217; son done comin&#8217;
back &#8217;cause Misteh Horace say he sho&#8217; goin&#8217; jus&#8217; tak&#8217;
care of him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Bo Peep, why do you not believe we&#8217;ll have
Horace here again?&#8221; Virginia asked.</p>
<p>The black man only shook his head mournfully as he
answered determinedly, &#8220;Ef yo&#8217; saves a life, you has to
give one for hit, mos&#8217; eveh time, an&#8217; mo&#8217; specially in the
Fillippians whah they&#8217;s so murderful and slaughterous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you ought not think that way,&#8221; Virginia urged.
&#8220;Run quick, now, and take the news to Asher. I don&#8217;t
know where he is this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s talkin&#8217; to Mr. Dabley Champehs out to the barn,&#8221;
Bo Peep said as he hurried away.</p>
<p>Asher Aydelot was standing before the big barn doors
when Darley Champers turned from the main road and
drove into the barnyard. It was a delicious April morning,
with all the level prairie lands smiling back at the skies
above them, and every breath of the morning breeze bearing
new vigor and inspiration in its caressing touch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Champers; fine morning to live,&#8221; Asher
called out cheerily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mornin&#8217;, Aydelot; fine day, fine! Miss Shirley told
me last fall she got her first inspiration for buyin&#8217; a
quarter of land with nothin&#8217; and faith, and makin&#8217; it pay
for itself, out of one of Coburn&#8217;s Agricultural Reports. I
reckon if a book like that could inspire a woman, they&#8217;s
plenty in a mornin&#8217; like this to inspire old Satan to a
more uprighteous line of goods than he generally carries.
I never see the country look better. Your wheat is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span>
tremendous. How&#8217;s the country look to you?&#8221; Champers
responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can remember when it looked a good deal worse,&#8221;
Asher replied. &#8220;The Coburn Reports must have helped to
turn bare prairie and weedy boom lots into harvest fields.&#8221;</p>
<p>The two men had seated themselves on the sloping driveway
before the barn doors. Asher was chewing the tender
joint of a spear of foxtail grass, and Champers had lighted
a heavy cigar.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t smoke, I believe,&#8221; he said cordially, &#8220;or I&#8217;d
insist on offering the mate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I just chew,&#8221; Asher replied, as he bent the foxtail
thoughtfully in his fingers and looked out toward the
wheat fields already rippling like waves under the morning
breeze.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Aydelot, do you remember the day I come down
this valley and tried my danged best to get you to sell
out for a song? I&#8217;ve done some pretty scaly things, all
inside the letter of the law, since then, but never anything
that&#8217;s stuck in my craw like that. I guess you ain&#8217;t forgot
it, neither?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember more of those first years than of these
later ones, and I haven&#8217;t forgotten when you came to the
Grass River schoolhouse one hot Sunday about grasshopper
time, but I don&#8217;t believe anybody holds it against
you. You were out for business just as we were,&#8221; Asher
replied with a genial smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say! D&#8217;recollect what you said to me when I invited
you to cast your glims over this very country, a burnt-up
old prairie that day, so scorched it was too dry and hot to
cut up into town lots for an addition to Hades?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span></p>
<p>Asher laughed now.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t remember anything about that. It was
just the general line of events that stayed with me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I do; and I&#8217;ll never forget the look in your eyes
when you said it, neither. I&#8217;d told you, as I say, just to
look at this God-forsaken old plain and tell me what you
see. And you looked, like you was glimpsin&#8217; heaven a&#8217;most,
and just said sorter solemn like an&#8217; prophetic: &#8216;I see a
land fair as the Garden of Eden, with grazing herds on
broad meadows, and fields on fields of wheat, and groves and
little lakes and rivers&mdash;a land of comfortable homes and
schoolhouses and churches, and no saloons nor breweries.&#8217;
And then I broke in and told you I see a danged fool, and
you says, &#8216;Come down here in twenty-five year and make
a hunt for me then.&#8217; And, by golly, Aydelot, here I am.
You&#8217;ve everlastingly conquered the prairies for sure, and
you are a young man, not fifty-five yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can see most of those things that I saw
that day out yonder, can&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Asher&#8217;s eyes followed the waving young wheat and the
blossoming orchards, the grove, full of birds&#8217; songs, and
the line of Grass River running deeper year by year. Then
he looked at his hard, brown hands and thought of the
toil and faith and hope that had gone into the conquest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;m still among the middle-aged,&#8221; he said,
straightening with his habitual military dignity of bearing.
&#8220;But I don&#8217;t know about this everlasting conquest of the
prairies. There&#8217;s still some of it waiting over beyond those
headlands in the open range where John Jacobs has a big
holding. I&#8217;ll never feel that I have conquered until my
boy proves himself in civil life as well as on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
battlefield. If I can bring him back when he is through with the
Orient, then, Darley Champers, I will have done something
beside subdue the soil. Through him, I&#8217;ll keep the wilderness
from ever getting hold again. If we live so narrowly
that our children hate the lines we follow and will not go on
and do still bigger things than we have done, do we really
make a success of life?&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment Bo Peep appeared with Doctor Carey&#8217;s
letter, and the subject shifted to the problems of the
far East.</p>
<p>&#8220;We aren&#8217;t the only people who are having trouble,&#8221;
Asher said. &#8220;I read in the papers that the Boxer uprising
that began in southern China last year is spreading northward
and making no end of disturbance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s them Boxers wantin&#8217;? Are they a band of
prize ring fellers?&#8221; Darley Champers asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pryor Gaines writes Jim Shirley that they are a secret
order of fanatics bent on stamping out all Christianity
and all western ideas of advancement in the Orient. Things
begin to look ugly in China, even from this distance.
When a band of religious fanatics like the Boxers go on
the warpath, their atrocities make a Cheyenne raid or a
Kiowa massacre look like a football game. I hope Pryor
will not be in their line of march.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pryor Gaines&#8217;d better stayed right here. It&#8217;s what&#8217;s
likely to happen to a man who goes missionarying too far,
and we could &#8217;a used him here.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was an unusual concession for Darley Champers to
make regarding the church, and Asher looked keenly at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Aydelot,&#8221; Champers said suddenly, &#8220;you have
more influence with John Jacobs &#8217;n anybody else, I know.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span>
If you see the Jew, pass it on to him that Wyker&#8217;s at his
old cut-ups again over in Wykerton, and he&#8217;s danged
bitter against Jacobs. I can help him on the side like
I did before, but the Jew&#8217;s got hold of enough over there
now to run things, with ownin&#8217; land all round and holdin&#8217;
mortgages on town property just to keep joints out of
&#8217;em. I do no end of business for Jacobs now. Never had
dealin&#8217;s with a straighter man. But he&#8217;d better look out
for Wyker. The Dutchman&#8217;s insides is all green with
poison, he&#8217;s hated Jacobs so many years.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess John will make it hard on him if they come to
blows again. The jail sentence and fine Jacobs fastened
on him let Wyker down easy. John Jacobs is one of the
state&#8217;s big men,&#8221; Asher responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;We lost another big man when we let Doc Carey go,&#8221;
Champers went on. &#8220;I used to set up nights and rest
myself hatin&#8217; him. He done the biggest missionary work
in me the two weeks I stayed at his house ever was done
for a benighted heathen. I hated to see him go.&#8221; The
sadness of the tone was genuine. &#8220;But I mustn&#8217;t be
hangin&#8217; round here all the mornin&#8217;; I&#8217;ve got other things
to do. Hope your boy&#8217;ll keep a-goin&#8217; till his term&#8217;s out.
Goodday!&#8221; And Champers was gone.</p>
<p>&#8220;Till his term&#8217;s out!&#8221; Asher repeated with a smile.
&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t that six-footer of a soldier boy, whose patriotism
burns like a furnace, see the joke to that! Till he
gets his stripes off and forgets the lock-step! My Thaine,
who is giving a young man&#8217;s strength of body and inspiration
of soul to his country&#8217;s service! But Carey did do
a missionary work in Champers. The fellow was crooked
enough &#8217;inside the law always,&#8217; as he said, but no more out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
of line than scores of reputable business men are today.
And the fact that he&#8217;s Jacobs&#8217; agent now measures the
degree of trustworthiness Carey has helped to waken
in him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Darley Champers&#8217; business took him down the river to
the Cloverdale Ranch, where he found Leigh Shirley training
the young vines up the trellis by the west porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;You got a mighty pretty place here; just looks like
Jim Shirley,&#8221; Champers declared as he greeted the young
gardener.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Uncle Jim is never so happy as when he is puttering
about the lawn and garden,&#8221; Leigh answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;s your alfalfa doin&#8217;?&#8221; Champers asked as he
turned toward the level stretch of rich green alfalfa fields.
&#8220;Danged money-maker for you,&#8221; he added jovially.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll clear the place with the first cutting this year.
It&#8217;s just the thing for Uncle Jim,&#8221; Leigh asserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yep, Jim&#8217;s in clover&mdash;alfalfa, ruther. You had a
good business head when you run your bluff some years
ago, an&#8217; you wan&#8217;t only nineteen then. You walked into
my place an&#8217; jest bought that land on sheer bluff.&#8221; Champers
laughed uproariously, but he grew sober in the next
minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Shirley,&#8221; he said gravely, &#8220;I ain&#8217;t got much
style nor sentiment in my makin&#8217;s, but I&#8217;ve honestly tried
to be humane by widders an&#8217; orphans. I&#8217;ve done men to
keep &#8217;em from doin&#8217; me, or jest &#8217;cause they was danged
easy, but I never wronged no woman, not even my wife,
who divorced me years ago back East &#8217;cause I wouldn&#8217;t
turn my old mother out o&#8217; doors, but kep&#8217; her and provided
for her long as she lived.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></p>
<p>Nobody in Kansas had ever heard Darley Champers
mention his home relations before. Leigh looked at him
gravely, and the sympathy in her deep blue eyes was grateful
to the uncultured man before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Shirley, I ain&#8217;t wantin&#8217; to meddle none, but I
come down here to ask you if you know anything about
your father?&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh gave a start and stared at her questioner, but her
woman&#8217;s instinct told her that only kindly purpose lay
back of his question.</p>
<p>He had sat down on the edge of the porch and Leigh
stood leaning against the trellis, clutching the narrow
slats, as she looked at him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he is dead,&#8221; she answered slowly. &#8220;Uncle Jim
says he must be. He was a bad man, made bad not
by blood but by selfishness. The Shirleys are a fine
family.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Excuse me for sayin&#8217; it, Miss, but you took every good
trait of that family, an&#8217; Nature jest shied every bad trait
as far from you as it took the sins of our old savage
Anglo-Saxon ancestors off of our heads; them that used
to kill an&#8217; eat their neighborin&#8217; tribes, like the Filipinos,
they was. Don&#8217;t never forget that you&#8217;re a Shirley an&#8217;
not a Tank. Your grandma&#8217;s name was Tank, I&#8217;ve been
told.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh made no response, but something in her face and
in the poise of her figure bespoke the truth of Darley
Champers&#8217; words.</p>
<p>&#8220;I jest come down to tell you,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that
the man I represented when I sold you this quarter, he represented
your father, Tank Shirley, and Tank got it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
through this man away from Jim out of pure hate. I sold
it back to you out of pure spite to Tank&#8217;s agent, who
was naggin&#8217; me. If your father is dead, there&#8217;d ought
to be somethin&#8217; comin&#8217; back, as the money you paid for
the land would help you some if we could get it back. I
come as a friend. I&#8217;m kinder in Doc Carey&#8217;s shoes while
he&#8217;s gone, you see. You&#8217;ve got the land as good as paid
for. It will be clear, you say, by June. Buyin&#8217; it of your
own father, if there&#8217;s any estate left of him, you&#8217;d ought
to have it. Money&#8217;s always a handy commodity, an&#8217; I&#8217;d
like to see you git what&#8217;s your&#8217;n after your plucky bluff
and winnin&#8217;. You could use it, I reckon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We need it very much,&#8221; Leigh assured him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, would you mind tellin&#8217; me if you find out anything
about your father&#8217;s whereabouts or anything?&#8221;
Champers queried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will,&#8221; Leigh replied, &#8220;but will you tell me what
you know about him; you must know something?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Champers&#8217; turn to start now. &#8220;N-not much; not
as much as I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to know, and it&#8217;s not for my
profit, neither. I don&#8217;t make money out of women&#8217;s needs.
I never made a cent on this sale to you, but it was worth
it to get to do that agent once,&#8221; Champers declared.</p>
<p>Leigh waited quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be in better shape inside of two days to tell you
something definite. I wish Carey was here. Do you know
where he got the money he loaned you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never asked him,&#8221; Leigh answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;He borrowed it of Miss Jane Aydelot of Cloverdale,
Ohio.&#8221;</p>
<p>Champers did not mean to be brutal, but the sharp cry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
of pain and the look of anguish on Leigh Shirley&#8217;s face
told how grievous was the wound his words had made.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you paid it all back; she ain&#8217;t lost nothin&#8217;.
Besides, I heard with my own ears folks sayin&#8217; she&#8217;d always
loved you and it was a pity Jim ever took you away from
her. She might &#8217;a done well by you, they said. You got no
wrong due. Lord knows you&#8217;ve paid it conscientiously
enough,&#8221; Darley Champers insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Champers, will you be sure to tell me all you know
as soon as possible? Meantime, I&#8217;ll try to find out something
to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure will. Goodday to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>When Champers rose to leave, Leigh put out her hand
to him, and the winning smile that made all Grass River
folk love her as they loved her uncle Jim now touched
the best spot in the heart of the man before her.</p>
<p>&#8220;God knows it&#8217;s a lot better to do for folks than to do
&#8217;em, and in the end I believe you prosper more at it. My
business, except the infernal boom days, never was so good
as it&#8217;s been since I had that time with Carey, and it&#8217;s all
clean business, too, not a smirch on it. Wish I could
forget a few things I&#8217;ve did, though.&#8221; So Darley Champers
thought, as he drove up the old Grass River trail in
the glory of the April morning.</p>
<p>That morning, Leigh Shirley wrote a long letter to Jane
Aydelot of Cloverdale, Ohio. Leigh had written many
letters to her before, but never one with a plea like this.
Miss Jane had mentally grown up with Leigh and had built
many a romance about her, which was only hinted at in the
letters she received.</p>
<p>In the letter of this morning, Leigh begged for all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
information Miss Jane could give concerning her father,
and further, she pleaded boldly for the reconciliation of the
Aydelot family, a thing she had never written of before.
Five days later her letter came back &#8220;unclaimed&#8221; with a
brief statement from the Cloverdale postmaster that Miss
Jane Aydelot had passed away on the day the letter was
written, much beloved, etc.</p>
<p>John Jacobs had no need to be warned by Asher Aydelot
of Hans Wyker&#8217;s doings. He knew all of Wyker&#8217;s movements
through Rosie Gimpke. Jacobs had been kind to
Rosie, whose bare, loveless life knew few kindnesses, and she
harbored the memory of a good deed as her grandfather
harbored his hatred. Moreover, the Wyker joint had
played havoc with the Gimpke family. Her father had
died from a fall received in a drunken brawl there. Two
brothers, too drunk to know better, had driven into Little
Wolf in a spring flood and been drowned. A sister had
married a drinking man who regularly beat her in his
regular sprees. For a heavy-footed, heavy-brained, fat
German girl, Rosie Gimpke could get into action with surprising
alacrity for the safety of one who had shown her
a kindness.</p>
<p>And it was Rosie Gimpke, whom John Jacobs called
the Wykerton W. C. T. U., who swiftly put the word to
him that her grandfather was again defying the law and
menacing the public welfare.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the messenger who served Rosie in this
emergency was overtaken by Hans and forced to divulge
his mission, threatened with dire evils if he said a word to
Rosie about Hans having halted him, and urged to go with
all haste on his errand, and to be sure of the reward, a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span>
ticket to the coming circus and two dishes of ice cream from
the Wyker eating house, as per Rosie&#8217;s promise.</p>
<p>The boy hastened from the grinning Hans and did his
errand, and afterward held his peace, so far as Rosie was
concerned. But he stupidly unloaded his message and
Hans&#8217; interference and threats to John Jacobs as an outsider
whom the Wyker family rows could not touch, and
had another dish of ice cream at Jacobs&#8217; expense.</p>
<p>This messenger was able, for he brought the word to
Rosie that John Jacobs would come to his Little Wolf
ranch the next day, and late in the evening drop into
Wykerton unexpectedly, where he knew Rosie would give
him easy access to the &#8220;blind tiger&#8221; of the Wyker House.
The boy carried a message also to Darley Champers to
meet Jacobs at the top of the hill above Little Wolf where
the trail with the scary little twist wound down by the
opening to the creek, beyond which the Gimpke home was
hidden. Then Hans Wyker, with threats of withholding
the circus ticket and the ice cream, was told both messages
just as they had been given to him for Rosie and Champers.
Hans, for reasons of his own, hurried out of Wykerton
and took the first train to Kansas City.</p>
<p>All this happened on the day that Darley Champers had
made his trip to the Cloverdale Ranch. The fine spring
weather of the morning leaped to summer heat in the
afternoon, as often happens in the plains country. On
the next day the heat continued, till late in the afternoon
a vicious black storm cloud swirled suddenly up over the
edge of the horizon, defying the restraining call of the
three headlands to sheer off to the south, as storms usually
sheered, and burst in fury on the Grass River Valley,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
extending east and north until the whole basin drained
by Big Wolf was threshed with a cyclone&#8217;s anger.</p>
<p>Darley Champers sat half asleep in his office on the
afternoon of this day. His coat and vest were flung on a
chair, his collar was on the floor under the desk, his sleeves
were rolled above his elbows. The heat affected his big
bulky frame grievously. The front door was closed to keep
out the afternoon glare, but the rear door, showing the
roomy back yard, was wide open, letting in whatever cool
air might wander that way.</p>
<p>Darley was half conscious of somebody&#8217;s presence as he
dozed. He dreamed a minute or two, then suddenly his
eyes snapped open just in time to see Thomas Smith
entering through the rear doorway.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; The voice was between a whine and
a snarl.</p>
<p>Champers stared and said nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too hot to be comfortable,&#8221; Smith said, seating
himself opposite Champers, &#8220;but you&#8217;re looking well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not,&#8221; Champers thought.</p>
<p>Thomas Smith was not looking well. Every mark of
the down-hill road was on him, to the last and surest mark
of poverty. The hang-dog expression of the face with
its close-set eyes and crooked scar above them showed how
far the evil life had robbed the man of power.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got in here yesterday morning, and you went out of
town right away,&#8221; Smith began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I seen you, and left immediately,&#8221; Champers
replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do you dodge me? Is it because you know I can
throw you? Or is it because I got full here once and beat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
you up a bit over in Wyker&#8217;s place?&#8221; Smith asked
smoothly, but with something cruel leaping up in his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t dodge you. I had business to see to and I hurried
to it, so I wouldn&#8217;t miss you this afternoon,&#8221; Champers
declared. &#8220;What do you want now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Money, and I&#8217;m going to have it,&#8221; Smith declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go get it, then!&#8221; Champers said coolly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go get it for me, and go quick,&#8221; Smith responded.
&#8220;I&#8217;m in a bad fix, I needn&#8217;t tell you. I&#8217;ve got to have
money; it&#8217;s what I live for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you. It&#8217;s all you ever did live for, and it&#8217;s
brought you where it&#8217;ll bring any man danged soon enough
who lives for it that way,&#8221; Champers asserted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since when did you join the Young Men&#8217;s Christian
Association?&#8221; Smith asked blandly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since day before yesterday.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of himself, Darley Champers felt his face flush
deeply. He had just responded to a solicitation from that
organization, assuring the solicitors that he &#8220;done it as a
business man and not that he was any prayer meetin&#8217;
exhorter, but the dollars was all cleaner&#8217;n a millionaire&#8217;s,
anyhow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; Smith went on. &#8220;Well, briefly, you
have a good many things to keep covered, you know, and,
likewise, so have your friends, the Shirleys. The girl paid
about all the mortgage on that ranch, I find.&#8221;</p>
<p>Darley Champers threw up his big hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bring her name in here,&#8221; he demanded savagely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, are you soft that way?&#8221; The sneer in the allusion
was contemptible. &#8220;All the better; you will get me
some money right away. Why, I haven&#8217;t let you favor me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span>
in a long time. You&#8217;ll be glad to do it now. Let me show
you exactly how.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paused a moment and the two looked steadily at
each other, each seeming sure of his ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;You will go to these Shirleys,&#8221; Smith continued, all
the hate of years making the name bitter to him, &#8220;and
you&#8217;ll arrange that they mortgage up again right away,
and you bring me the money. They can easy get three
thousand on that ranch now, it&#8217;s so well set to alfalfa.
Nothing else will do but just that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And if I don&#8217;t go?&#8221; Darley Champers asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;ll go. You don&#8217;t want this Y. M. C. A. crowd
to know all I can tell. No, you don&#8217;t. And Jim Shirley
and that girl Leigh don&#8217;t want me to publish all I know
about the father and brother, Tank. It might be hard on
both of &#8217;em. Oh, I&#8217;ve got you all there. You can&#8217;t get
away from me and think because I&#8217;m hard up I have lost
my grip on you. <i>I&#8217;ll never do that.</i> I can disgrace you
all so Grass River wouldn&#8217;t wash your names clean again.
So run along. You and the Shirleys will do as I say. You
don&#8217;t <i>dare</i> not to. And this pretty Leigh, such a gross
old creature as you are fond of, she can work herself to
skin and bone to pay off another mortgage to help Jim.
Poor fellow can&#8217;t work like most men, big as he is. I
remember when he got started wrong in his lungs back in
Ohio when he was a boy. He blamed Tank for shutting
him out in the cold one night, or something like it. That
give him his start. He always blamed Tank for everything.
Why, he and Tank had a fight the last time they
were together, and he nearly broke his brother&#8217;s arm off&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, shut up,&#8221; Champers snapped out.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, be active. I&#8217;ll give you till tomorrow night;
that&#8217;s ample,&#8221; Smith snapped back. &#8220;Hans and you are
all the people in town who know I&#8217;m here now except the fat
woman who waits on the table at Wyker&#8217;s. I&#8217;m lying low
right now, but I won&#8217;t stay hid long; Wyker&#8217;ll keep me
over one more day, I reckon. Even he&#8217;s turned against
me when I&#8217;ve got no money to loan him, but I&#8217;ll be on
my feet again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Smith, come in tomorrow night, but don&#8217;t hurry
away now.&#8221; The big man&#8217;s tone was too level to show
which way his meaning ran. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to go into matters
a little with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith settled back in his chair and waited with the air
of one not to be coaxed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right in sayin&#8217; I&#8217;d like to hide some transactions.
Not many real estate men went through the boom
days here who don&#8217;t need to feel that way. We was all
property mad, and you and me and Wyker run our bluff
same as any of &#8217;em, an&#8217; we busted the spirit of the law to
flinders. And our givin&#8217; and gettin&#8217; deeds and our buyin&#8217;
tax titles an&#8217; forty things we done, was so irregular it
might or mightn&#8217;t stand in court now, dependin&#8217; altogether
on how good a lawyer for technicalities we was able to
employ. We know&#8217;d the game we was playin&#8217;, too, and
excused ourselves, thinkin&#8217; the Lord wouldn&#8217;t find us special
among so many qualified for the same game. Smith, I
know danged well I&#8217;m not so &#8217;shamed of that as I should be.
The thing that hurts me wouldn&#8217;t be cards for you at all.
It&#8217;s the brutal, inhumane things no law can touch me for;
it&#8217;s trying to do honest men out&#8217;n their freeholds; it&#8217;s
holdin&#8217; back them grasshopper sufferer supplies, an&#8217; havin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
the very men I robbed treatin&#8217; me like a gentleman now,
that&#8217;s cutting my rhinoceros hide into strips and hangin&#8217;
it on the fence. But you can&#8217;t capitalize a thing like that
in your business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I know what I can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As to what you can do to me, you&#8217;ve run that bluff
till it&#8217;s slick on the track. And I&#8217;ve know&#8217;d it just as long
as you have, anyhow. Here&#8217;s my particular stunt with
you. I had business East in &#8217;96, time of the big May flood,
and I run down to Cloverdale, Ohio, for a day. The waters
was up higher&#8217;n they&#8217;d been know&#8217;d for some years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thomas Smith had stiffened in his chair and sat rigidly
gripping the arms. But Champers seemed not to notice
this as he continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;The fill where the railroad cuts acrost the old Aydelot
farm was washed out and kep&#8217; down the back water from
floodin&#8217; the low ground. But naturally it washed out
considerable right there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Smith&#8217;s face was deadly pale now, with the crooked scar
a livid streak across his forehead. Champers deliberated
before he went on. All his blustering method disappeared
and he kept to the even tone and unruffled demeanor.</p>
<p>&#8220;The danged little crick t&#8217;other side of town got rampageous
late in the afternoon, and the whole crowd that
had watched Clover Crick all day went pellmellin&#8217; off to see
new sights, leavin&#8217; me entirely alone by the washout. I
remember what you said about pretendin&#8217; to commit yourself
to your Maker there in an agreement between you
as cashier an&#8217; Tank Shirley, an&#8217; the place interested me
a lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>A finer-fibred man could hardly have resisted the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
agonized face of Thomas Smith. A cowardly nature would
have feared the anger back of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was gettin&#8217; late and pretty cloudy still, and nobody
by, an&#8217; I staid round, an&#8217; staid round, when just at the
right place the bank broke away and I see the body of a
man&mdash;just the skeleton mainly, right where you didn&#8217;t
commit your pretended suicide. Somebody committed it
there for you evidently. There was only a few marks of
identification, a big set ring with a jagged break in the set
that swiped too swift acrost a man&#8217;s face might leave a
ugly scar for life, and if the fellow tried too hard to drown
hisself he might wrench a man&#8217;s right arm so out o&#8217; plum
he couldn&#8217;t never do much signin&#8217; his name again. I disposed
of the remains decent as I could, for Doc Carey was
leisurely coming down National pike from Jane Aydelot&#8217;s,
an&#8217; it was gettin&#8217; late, an&#8217; no cheerful plate nor job in a
crowd in sunshiny weather, let alone there in the dusk of
the evening. Wow! I dreamt of that there gruesome thing
two weeks. I throwed the shovel in the crick. Would
you like me to show you where to go to dig, so&#8217;s you can
be sure your plan with Tank Shirley worked and you didn&#8217;t
drown, after all? And are you sure you ain&#8217;t been misrepresenting
things to me a little as agent for Tank Shirley?
Are you right sure you ain&#8217;t Tank Shirley himself?
I&#8217;ve kep&#8217; still for four years, not to save you nor myself,
but to keep Leigh Shirley&#8217;s name from bein&#8217; dragged into
court &#8217;longside a name like yours or mine. I never misuse
the women, no matter how tricky I am with men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, as an afterthought, Champers added:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s so danged hot this afternoon I can&#8217;t get over to
Grass River; and I got word to meet Jacobs over at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
Little Wolf Ranch later, so I think I&#8217;ll take the crooked
trail up to that place; it&#8217;s a lot the coolest road, and I&#8217;ll
wait till the sun&#8217;s most down. I guess that three thousand
dollar mortgage can wait over a day now, less you feel too
cramped.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thomas Smith rose from his chair. His face was ashy
and his small black eyes burned with a wicked fire. He
gave one long, steady look into Champers&#8217; face and slipped
from the rear door like a shadow.</p>
<p>Darley Champers knew he had won the day, and no sense
of personal danger had ever troubled him. He settled back
in his chair, drew a long sigh of relief, and soon snored
comfortably through his afternoon&#8217;s nap.</p>
<p>When he awoke it was quite dark, for the storm cloud
covered the sky and the hot breath from the west was like
the air from a furnace mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not late, but it&#8217;s danged hot. I wonder why that
Jew wanted me to meet him over there. Couldn&#8217;t he have
come here? I&#8217;m wet with sweat now. How&#8217;ll I be by the
time I get out to that ranch?&#8221; Champers stretched his
limbs and mopped his hot neck with his handkerchief. &#8220;I
reckon I&#8217;d better go, though. Jacobs always knows why he
wants a thing. And he&#8217;s the finest man ever came out of
Jewey. With him in town and Asher Aydelot on a farm,
no city nor rural communities could be more blessed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then he remembered Thomas Smith and a cold shiver
seized his big, perspiring body.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder why I dread to go,&#8221; he said, half aloud.
&#8220;The creek trail will be cool, but, golly, I&#8217;m danged cold
right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again his mind ran to Smith&#8217;s face as he had seen it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
last. He put on his hat and started to take his long
raincoat off the hook behind the rear door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Reckon I&#8217;d better take it. It looks like storming,&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;Hello! What the devil!&#8221;</p>
<p>For Rosie Gimpke, with blazing cheeks and hair dripping
with perspiration, was hidden behind the coat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Champers, go queek and find Yon Yacob, but
don&#8217;t go the creek roat. I coom slippin&#8217; to tell you to go
sure, and I hit when that strange man coom slippin&#8217; in.
I hear all you say, an&#8217; I see him troo der crack here, an&#8217; he
stant out there a long time looking back in here. So I
half to wait an&#8217; you go nappin&#8217; an&#8217; I still wait. I wait to
say, hurry, but don&#8217;t go oop nor down der creek trail. I do
anything for Miss Shirley, an&#8217; I like you for takin&#8217; care
off her goot name; goot names iss hardt to get back if dey
gets avay. Hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven bless your good soul!&#8221; Champers said heartily.
&#8220;But why not take the cool road? I&#8217;ve overslept and I&#8217;ve
got to hurry and the storm&#8217;s hustling in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t, please don&#8217;t take it,&#8221; Rosie begged.</p>
<p>The next minute she was gone and as Champers closed
and locked his doors he said to himself, &#8220;She does her work
like a hero and never will have any credit for it, &#8217;cause she&#8217;s
not a pioneer nor a soldier. But she has saved more than
one poor fellow snared into that joint I winked at for
years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, obedient to her urging, he followed the longer,
hotter road toward the Jacobs&#8217; stock ranch bordering on
Little Wolf Creek.</p>
<p>Meantime, John Jacobs inspected his property, forgetful
of the intense heat and the coming storm, his mind full of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
a strange foreboding. At the top of the hill above where
the road wound down through deep shadows he sat a long
while on his horse. &#8220;I wonder what makes me so lonely
this evening,&#8221; he mused. &#8220;I&#8217;m not of a lonely nature,
nor morose, thank the Lord! There&#8217;s no telling why we do
or don&#8217;t want to do things. I wonder where Champers is.
He ought to be coming up pretty soon. I wonder if I
hadn&#8217;t had that dream two nights ago about that picture
I saw in a book, when I was a little chap, if I&#8217;d had this
fool&#8217;s cowardice about being out here alone today. And
what was it that made me look over all those papers in my
vault box last night? I have helped Careyville some, and
the library I built will have a good endowment when I&#8217;m
gone, and so will the children&#8217;s park, and the Temperance
Societies. Maybe I&#8217;ve not lived in vain, if I have been an
exacting Jew. I never asked for the blood in my pound of
flesh, anyhow. I wonder where Champers can be.&#8221;</p>
<p>He listened intently and thought he heard someone coming
around the bend down the darkening way.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s he, I guess, now,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Then he turned his face toward the wide prairie unrolling
to the westward. Overhanging it were writhing clouds,
hurled hither and thither, twisted, frayed, and burst asunder
by the titanic forces of the upper air, and all converging
with centripetal violence toward one vast maelstrom. Its
long, funnel-shaped form dipped and lifted, trailing back
and forth like some sensate thing. With it came an increasing
roar from the clashing of timber up the valley. The
vivid shafts of lightning and the blackness that followed
them made the scene terrific with Nature&#8217;s majestic madness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must get shelter somewhere,&#8221; Jacobs said. &#8220;I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_352' name='page_352'></a>352</span>
sorry Champers failed me. I wanted his counsel before I
slipped up on Wyker tonight. I thought I heard him
coming just now. Maybe he&#8217;s waiting for me under cover.
I&#8217;ll go down and see.&#8221;</p>
<p>The roar of the cyclone grew louder and the long swinging
funnel lifted and dipped and lifted again, as the awful
forces of the air hurled it onward.</p>
<p>Down at the sharp bend in the road Thomas Smith was
crouching, just where the rift in the bank opened to the
creek, and the face of the man was not good to look upon
nor to remember.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll show Darley Champers how well my left hand
works. There&#8217;ll be no telltale scar left on his face when
I&#8217;m through, and he can tumble right straight down to
the water from here and on to hell, and Wyker&#8217;s joint may
bear the blame. Damned old Dutchman, to turn me out
now. I set him up in business when I had money. Here
comes Champers now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The storm-cloud burst upon the hill at that moment.
John Jacobs&#8217; horse leaped forward on the steep slope, slid,
and fell to its knees. As it sprang up again the two men
could not see each other, for a flash of lightning blinded
them and in the crash of thunder that burst at the same
instant, filling the valley with deafening roar, the sharp
report of a double pistol-shot was swallowed up.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>An hour later Darley Champers, drenched with rain,
stumbled down the crooked trail in the semi-darkness. The
cool air came fanning out of the west and a faint rift along
the horizon line gave promise of a glorious April sunset.</p>
<p>As Darley reached the twist in the trail which John
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
Jacobs always dreaded, the place Thaine Aydelot and Leigh
Shirley had invested with sweet memories, he suddenly drew
his rein and stared in horror.</p>
<p>Lying in the rift with his head toward the deep waters
of Little Wolf Creek lay Thomas Smith, scowling with
unseeing eyes at the fast clearing sky. While on the farther
side of the road lay the still form of John Jacobs, rain-beaten
and smeared with mud, as if he had struggled backward
in his death-throes.</p>
<p>As Champers bent tenderly over him, the smile on his
lips took away the awfulness of the sight, and the serenity
of the rain-drenched face rested as visible token of an
abundant entrance into eternal peace.</p>
<p>Grass River and Big Wolf settlements had never before
known a tragedy so appalling as the assassination of John
Jacobs at the hands of an &#8220;unknown&#8221; man. Hans Wyker
had gone to Kansas City on the day before the event and
Wykerton never saw his face again. Rosie Gimpke, who
did not know the stranger&#8217;s name, and Darley Champers,
who thought he did, believed nothing could be gained by
talking, so they held their peace. And Thomas Smith went
&#8220;unknown&#8221; back to the dust of the prairie in the Grass
River graveyard.</p>
<p>The coroner tried faithfully to locate the blame. But as
Jacobs was unarmed and was shot from the front, and the
stranger had only one bullet in his revolver and was shot
from behind, and as nobody lost nor gained by not untangling
the mystery, the affair after a nine days&#8217; complete
threshing, went into local history, the place of sepulchre.</p>

<p>Darley CHAMPERS sat in his little office absorbed
in business. The May morning was ideal. Through
the front door the sounds of the street drifted in. Through
the rear door the roomy backyard, which was Champers&#8217;
one domestic pleasure, sent in an odor of white lilac. By all
the rules Champers should have preferred hollyhocks and
red peonies, if he had cared for flowers at all. It was for
the memory of the old mother, whom he would not turn
adrift to please a frivolous wife, that he grew the white
blossoms she had loved. But as he never spoke of her,
nor seemed to see any other flowers, nobody noticed the
peculiarity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder how I missed that mail?&#8221; he mused, as he
turned a foreign envelope in his hands. &#8220;I reckon the sight
of that poor devil, Smith, dropping into town so suddenly
five days ago upset me so I forgot my mail and went to
see the Shirleys. And the hot afternoon and Smith&#8217;s coming
in here, and&mdash;&#8221;Darley leaned back in his chair and
sighed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_355' name='page_355'></a>355</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Jacobs! Why should he be taken? Smith was
gunning for me and mistook his man. Lord knows I
wasn&#8217;t fit to go.&#8221;</p>
<p>He leaned his elbow heavily on the table, resting his head
on his hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Jacobs went on in my place, sacrificed for my sins,
so help me God, I&#8217;ll carry on his work here. I&#8217;ll fight the
liquor business to the end of my days. There shan&#8217;t no
joint nor doggery never open a door on Big Wolf no more.
I&#8217;ll do a man&#8217;s part for the world I&#8217;ve been doin&#8217; for my
own profit most of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>His brow cleared, and a new expression came to the bluff
countenance. The humaneness within him was doing its
perfect work.</p>
<p>&#8220;But about this mail, now.&#8221; He took up the letter
again. &#8220;Carey says he ain&#8217;t coming back. Him and
young Aydelot&#8217;s dead sure to go to China soon. An&#8217; I&#8217;m to
handle his business as per previous directions. This is the
first of it. Somebody puttin&#8217; on mournin&#8217; style, I reckon.&#8221;</p>
<p>Champers took up a black-edged envelope, whose contents
told him as Dr. Horace Carey&#8217;s representative that
Miss Jane Aydelot of Cloverdale was no longer living and
much more as unnecessary to the business of the moment
as a black-bordered envelope is unnecessary to the business
of life. Then he opened a drawer in his small office
safe and took out a bundle of letters.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s a copy of her will. That&#8217;s to go to Miss Shirley
to read. An&#8217; a copy of old Francis Aydelot&#8217;s will.
What&#8217;s the value of that, d&#8217; you reckon? Also to be
showed to Miss Leigh Shirley. An&#8217; here&#8217;s&mdash;what?&#8221;</p>
<p>Darley Champers opened the last envelope and began to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_356' name='page_356'></a>356</span>
read. He stopped suddenly and gave a long surprised
whistle.</p>
<p>Beautiful as the morning was, the man laid down the
papers, carefully locked both doors and drew down the
front blinds. He took up the envelope and read its contents.
He read them a second time. Then he put down
the neatly written pages and sat staring at nothing for a
long time. He took them up at length for a third reading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything comes out at last,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Oh,
Lord, I&#8217;m glad Doc Carey got hold of me when he did.&#8221;</p>
<p>Slowly he ran his eyes down the lines as he read in a
half whisper:</p>
<div style='font-size:smaller'>

<p>I was walking down the National pike road toward Cloverdale
with little Leigh in the twilight. Where the railroad crosses
Clover Creek on the high fill we saw Tank Shirley and the young
cashier, Terrence Smalley, who had disappeared after the bank
failure. It seems Tank had promised to pay Smalley to stay
away and to find Jim and get his property away from him. Evidently
Tank had not kept his word, for they were quarreling and
came to blows until the cashier&#8217;s face was cut and bleeding above
the eye. There was a struggle, and one pushed the other over the
bank into the deep water there. Little as Leigh was, she knew
one of the men was her father, and we thought he had pushed
Smalley into the creek. He had a sort of paralyzed arm and
could not swim. I tried to make her forget all about it. I promised
her my home and farm some day if she would never tell what
she had seen. She shut her lips, but if she forgot, I cannot tell.</p>
<p>That night I went alone to the fill and found Terrence Smalley
with a cut face and a twisted shoulder lying above the place
where Tank went down. I helped him to my home and dressed
his wounds. I may have done wrong not to deliver him to the
authorities, but he had a bad story to tell of Tank&#8217;s bank record
that would have disgraced the Shirley family in Ohio, so we made
an agreement. He would never make himself known to Leigh,
nor in any way disturb her life nor reveal anything of her
father&#8217;s life to disgrace her name, if I let him go. And I agreed
not to report what I had seen, nor to tell what I knew to his
hurt. He promised me also never to show his face in Cloverdale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_357' name='page_357'></a>357</span>
again. He was a selfish, dishonest man, who used Tank Shirley&#8217;s
hatred of his brother and his other sins to hide his own wrongdoing.
But I tried to do my duty by the innocent ones who must
suffer, when I turned him loose with his conscience. I do not
know what has become of him, but, so far as I do know, he has
kept the secret of Tank Shirley&#8217;s crooked dealing with the Cloverdale
bank, and he has never annoyed Leigh, nor brought any
disgrace to her name. This statement duly witnessed, etc.</p>
</div>

<p>Slowly Darley Champers read. Then, laying down the
pages, he said as slowly: &#8220;&#8216;Unknown&#8217; in the Grass River
graveyard. &#8217;Unknown&#8217; to Jim Shirley and Asher Aydelot,
whose eyes he&#8217;d never let see him. I understand now,
why. Known to me as Thomas Smith, an escaped defaultin&#8217;
bank cashier who didn&#8217;t commit suicide. Known to the late
Miss Aydelot as Tank Shirley&#8217;s murderer. If the devil
knows where to git on the track of that scoundrel an&#8217; locate
him properly in hell, he&#8217;ll do it without my help. By
the Lord Almighty, I&#8217;ll never tell what I know. An&#8217; this
paper goes to ashes here. Oh, Caesar! If I could only
burn up the recollection that I was ever low-down an&#8217;
money-grubbin&#8217; enough to collute with such as him for
business. I&#8217;m danged glad I had that quarter kep&#8217; in
Leigh&#8217;s name &#8217;stead of Jim&#8217;s. That&#8217;s why Thomas Smith
threatened and didn&#8217;t act. He didn&#8217;t dare to go against
Leigh as long as Jane Aydelot was livin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stuck a blazing match to the letter and watched it
crumple to ashes on the rusty stove-hearth. Then he carefully
swept the ashes on a newspaper, and, opening his
doors again, he scattered them in the dusty main street of
Wykerton.</p>
<p>That afternoon Champers went again to the Cloverdale
Ranch. Leigh was alone, busy with her brushes and paint-board
in the seat on the lawn where Thaine Aydelot had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_358' name='page_358'></a>358</span>
found her on the summer day painting sunflowers. The
first little sunflower was blooming now by the meadow fence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t git up, Miss Shirley. Keep your seat, mom. I
dropped in on a little business. I&#8217;m glad to set out here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Champers took off his hat and fanned his red face as he
sat on the ground and looked out at the winding river bordered
by alfalfa fields.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nice stand you got out there.&#8221; He pointed with his
hat toward the fields. &#8220;Where&#8217;s Jim?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He and Asher Aydelot have gone to Careyville to settle
some of John Jacobs&#8217; affairs. They and Todd Stewart
are named as trustees in the will,&#8221; Leigh replied.</p>
<p>She had laid aside her brushes and sat with her hands
folded in her lap. Champers pulled up a spear of blue-grass
and chewed it thoughtfully. At length he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I knew that. Jacobs left no end of things in the
way of property for me to look after. I&#8217;ll report to them
now. I seem to be general handy man. Doc Carey left
matters with me, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; Leigh said courteously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, referrin&#8217; to that matter regardin&#8217; your father
we spoke of the other day, I find, through Doc Carey&#8217;s
helpin&#8217; an&#8217; some other ways, that your father, Mr. Tank
Shirley, was accidentally drowned in Clover Creek, Ohio,
some years ago. So far as I can find out, he died insolvent.
If I discover anything further, I&#8217;ll let you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh sat very still, her eyes on the far-away headlands
that seemed like blue cloud banks at the moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Had you heard of Miss Jane Aydelot&#8217;s demise? I
reckon you had, of course. But do you know what her
intentions were?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_359' name='page_359'></a>359</span></p>
<p>Leigh looked steadily at her questioner. All her life
she had had a way of keeping her own counsel, nor was
it ever easy to know what her thoughts might be.</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Shirley, the late Miss Jane Aydelot trusted
Doc Carey to look after her affairs. Doc Carey, he trusted
me to take his place. Can you trust me to be the last
link of the chain in doin&#8217; her business? My grammar&#8217;s
poor, but my hands is clean now, thank the Lord!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Champers, I am sure of your uprightness.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh did not dream how grateful these words were to
the man before her, honestly trying to beat back to better
ideals of life.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was a very little girl,&#8221; Leigh went on, &#8220;Miss
Jane told me I was to be her heir.&#8221;</p>
<p>Darley gave a start, but as Leigh&#8217;s face was calm, he
could only wonder how much she had remembered.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the years since I&#8217;ve lived in Kansas I&#8217;ve been kept
in mind in many ways of her favor toward me. I came
to know long ago that she was determined to leave me all
the old Aydelot estate. And I knew also that it should
have been Asher&#8217;s, not mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Darley thought of Thaine, and, dull as he was, he read
in a flash a romance that many a finer mind might have
missed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, sufferin&#8217; catfish!&#8221; he said to himself. &#8220;Danged
plucky girl; forges along an&#8217; bucks me into sellin&#8217; her this
ranch an&#8217; sets it into alfalfy an&#8217; sets up Jim Shirley for life,
&#8217;cause putterin&#8217; in the garden an&#8217; bein&#8217; kind to the neighbors
is the limit to that big man&#8217;s endurance. An&#8217; this
pretty girl, knowin&#8217; that Aydelot property ought to be
Thaine Aydelot&#8217;s, just turns it down, an&#8217;, by golly, I&#8217;ll
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_360' name='page_360'></a>360</span>
bet she turns him down, too, fearin&#8217; he wouldn&#8217;t feel like
takin&#8217; it. An&#8217; he&#8217;s clear hiked to the edges of Chiny.
Well, it&#8217;s a danged queer world. I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;ve only got
Darley Champers to look out for. The day I see them two
drivin&#8217; out of Wykerton towards Little Wolf, the time
she&#8217;d closed the Cloverdale ranch deal, I knowed the white
lilac mother used to love was sweeter in my back lot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I could not take Miss Jane&#8217;s property and be happy,&#8221;
Leigh went on. &#8220;Besides, I can earn a living. See what
my brushes can do, and see the secret I learned in the
Coburn book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh held up the sketch she was finishing, then pointed
to the broad alfalfa acres, refreshingly green in the May
sunlight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I brought down a copy of the late Miss Aydelot&#8217;s
will that she left with Doc Carey, who is goin&#8217; to Chiny
in a few days, him an&#8217; Thaine Aydelot, Doc writes me. An&#8217;
you can look over it. I&#8217;ve got to go to Cloverdale next
week an&#8217; settle things there, an&#8217; see that the probatin&#8217;s
are straight. Lemme hear from you before I go. I must be
gettin&#8217; on. Danged fine country, this Grass River Valley.
Who&#8217;d a&#8217; thought it back in the seventies when Jim Shirley
an&#8217; Asher Aydelot squatted here? Goodday.&#8221;</p>
<p>Left alone, Leigh Shirley opened the big envelope holding
the will of Francis Aydelot and read in it the stern
decree that no child of Virginia Thaine should inherit the
Aydelot estate in Ohio.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why Miss Jane couldn&#8217;t leave it to Asher&#8217;s son,&#8221;
she murmured.</p>
<p>Then she read the will of the late Jane Aydelot. When
she lifted her face from its pages, her fair cheeks were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_361' name='page_361'></a>361</span>
pink with excitement, her deep violet eyes were shining, her
lips were parted in a glad smile. She went down to the
meadow fence and plucked the first little golden sunflower
from its stem, and stood holding it as she looked away to
where the three headlands stood up clear and shimmering
in the light of the May afternoon. That night two letters
were hurried to the postoffice. One went no farther than
Wykerton to tell Darley Champers that Leigh would
heartily approve of any action he might take in the business
that was taking him to Ohio.</p>

<p>Dr. Carey and Thaine Aydelot sat watching the play
of a fountain in a moonlit garden of tropical loveliness.
In the Manila hospital Thaine had gone far down
the Valley of the Shadow of Death before he reached a
turning point. But youth, good blood, a constitution seasoned
by camp and field, the watchful care of his physician,
and the blessing of the Great Physician, from whom is all
health, at last prevailed, and he came back sturdily to life
and strength.</p>
<p>As the two men sat enjoying the hour Dr. Carey suddenly
asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;After this hospital service, what next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How soon does this involuntary servitude end?&#8221; Thaine
inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;A fortnight will do all that is possible for us,&#8221; Carey
answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll enlist with the regulars,&#8221; Thaine declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean to follow a military life?&#8221; Carey inquired,
bending forward to watch the play of light on the silvery
waters, unconscious of the play of moonbeams on his silvery
hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not always,&#8221; Thaine responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t you go home now?&#8221; Carey went on.</p>
<p>Thaine sat silent for some minutes. Then he rose to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_363' name='page_363'></a>363</span>
his full height, the strong, muscular, agile embodiment of
military requirement. On his face the firing line had
graven a nobility the old brown Kansas prairies had never
seen.</p>
<p>He did not know how to tell Dr. Carey, because he did
not yet fully understand himself, that war to him must
be a means, not an end, to his career; nor that in the
long quiet hours in the hospital the call of the Kansas
prairies, half a world away, was beginning to reach his
ears, the belief that the man behind the plow may be no
less a patriot than the man behind the gun; that the lifelong
influence of his farmer father and mother was unconsciously
winning him back to the peaceful struggle with the soil.
At length he said slowly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Carey, when I saw Lieutenant Alford brought in
I counted the cost again. Only American ideals of government
and civilization can win this wilderness. For this
Alford&#8217;s blood was shed. He wrote to his mother on
Christmas day that he was studying here to get his Master&#8217;s
Degree from the Kansas University. I saw him just after
he had received his diploma for that Degree. I was a fairly
law-abiding civilian. The first shot of the campaign last
February began in me what Alford&#8217;s sacrifice completed.
I am waiting to see what next. But I have one thing
firmly fixed now. Warfare only opens the way for the
wilderness winners to come in and make a kingdom. The
Remington rifle runs back the frontier line; the plowshare
holds the land at last. I want, when my service here is
done, to go back to the wheatfields and the cornfields. I
want to smell the alfalfa and see the prairie windbreaks and
be king of a Kansas farm. I&#8217;ve lost my ambition for gold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_364' name='page_364'></a>364</span>
lace. I want a bigger mental ring of growth every year,
and I believe the biggest place for me to get this will be
with my feet on the prairie sod. Meantime, I shall reenlist,
as I said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down, Thaine, and let me ask you one question,&#8221;
Dr. Carey said.</p>
<p>The young man dropped to his seat again.</p>
<p>&#8220;When your service is done is there anything to hold
you from going straight to the Grass River Valley again?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine leaned back in his chair and clasped his hands
behind his head while he looked steadily at the splashing
waters before him as he said frankly:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, there is. When I go back I want Leigh Shirley&mdash;and
it&#8217;s no use wanting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine, you were a law-abiding civilian at home. The
university made you a student. You came out here a
fearless soldier to fight your country&#8217;s enemies. Alford&#8217;s
death made you a patriot who would plant American ideals
in these islands. May I tell you that there is still one more
lesson to learn?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine looked up inquiringly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You must learn to be a Christian. You must know
what service for humanity means. Then the call to duty
will be a bugle note of victory wherever that duty may be.
You needn&#8217;t hunt for opportunity to prove this. The
opportunity is hurrying toward you now from out of the
Unknown.&#8221;</p>
<p>The fine head with the heavy masses of white hair seemed
halo-crowned at that moment. It was as he appeared that
night that Thaine Aydelot always remembers him. Two
weeks later Thaine enlisted in the Fourteenth United States
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_365' name='page_365'></a>365</span>
Infantry, stationed in Luzon. Dr. Carey was also enrolled
in its hospital staff. In July the regiment was ordered from
the Philippines to join the allied armies of the World
Powers at Tien-Tsin in a northern Chinese province, where
the Boxer forces were massing about Peking. And Thaine&#8217;s
opportunity for learning his greatest lesson came hurrying
toward him from out of the Unknown.</p>
<p>This notorious Boxer uprising, gone now into military
annals, had reached the high tide of its power. Beginning
in the southern province of China, it spread northward,
menacing the entire Empire. A secret sect at first, it was
augmented by the riffraff that feeds on any new, and especially
lawless, body; by deserters disloyal to the imperial
government; by the ignorant and the unthinking; by the
intimidated and the intimidating. It enrolled an armed force
of one hundred and seventy-five thousand soldiers. Its
purposes were fanatical. It aimed by the crudest means
to root out every idea of modern life and thought in China;
every occidental invention, every progressive method of
society, every scientific discovery for the betterment of
humanity. And especially did it aim to put to death every
native Chinese Christian, to massacre every missionary of
the Christ, and to drive out or destroy every foreign citizen
in China. Its resources were abundant, its equipment was
ample, its methods unspeakably atrocious. Month after
month the published record of this rebellion was sickening&mdash;its
unwritten history beyond human imagining. Impenetrable
were its walled cities, countless in numbers,
unknown the scenes of its vast plains and rivers and barren
fields and mountain fastnesses. Fifteen thousand native
Christians and hundreds of foreigners were brutally
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_366' name='page_366'></a>366</span>
massacred. At last it centered its strength about the great city
of Peking. And a faint, smothered wail for deliverance
came from the Foreign Legation shut in behind beleaguered
walls inside that city to starve or perish at the hands of the
bloody Boxers.</p>
<p>Very patiently the World Powers waited and warned the
Chinese leaders of a day of retribution. Fanatics are
fanatics because they cannot learn. The conditions only
whetted the Boxers to greater barbarity. They believed
themselves invincible and they laughed to scorn all thought
of foreign interference. Then came the sword of the Lord
and of Gideon to the battle lines at Tien-Tsin on the Peiho
River, as it came once long ago to the valley of Jezreel.</p>
<p>In the mid-afternoon of an August day Thaine Aydelot
heard the bugle note calling the troops to marching order.
Thaine was fond of the bugler, a little fifteen-year-old
Kansas boy named Kemper, because he remembered that
Asher Aydelot had been a drummer boy once when he was
no older than &#8220;Little Kemper,&#8221; as the regiment called him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you were where my father is now, Kemper,&#8221;
Thaine said as the boy skipped by him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that? It can&#8217;t be hell or he&#8217;d be with us,&#8221;
Little Kemper replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, he&#8217;s in Kansas,&#8221; Thaine said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s right next door to heaven, but I can&#8217;t go
just yet. There&#8217;s too much doing here,&#8221; the little bugler
declared as he hurried away.</p>
<p>Young as he was, Little Kemper was the busiest member
of the regiment. Life with him was a continual &#8220;doing&#8221;
and he did it joyously and well.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something doing here.&#8221; Thaine hardly had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_367' name='page_367'></a>367</span>
time to think it as the armies came into their places. It
was the third day after the regiment had reached Tien-Tsin.
Along the Peiho river lay a sandy plain with scant tillage
and great stretches of barren lands. Here and there were
squalid villages with now and then a few more pretentious
structures with adobe brick walls and tiled roofs. Everywhere
was the desolation of ignorance and fear, saddening
enough, without the Boxer rebellion to intensify it with
months of dreadful warfare.</p>
<p>As Thaine fell into his place he thought of the Aydelot
wheatfields and of the alfalfa that Leigh Shirley&#8217;s patient
judgment had helped to spread over the Cloverdale Ranch.
And even in the face of such big things as he was on his
way to meet the conquest of the prairie soil seemed
wonderful.</p>
<p>Big things were waiting him now, and his heart throbbed
with their bigness as his regiment took its place. It was
a wonderful company that fell into line and swung up the
Peiho river that August afternoon. The world never saw
its like before, and may never see it again. Not wonderful
in numbers, for there were only sixteen thousand of the
allied armies, all told, to pit themselves against an armed
force able to line up one hundred and sixteen thousand
against them. Not numbers, but varying nationalities, varying
races, strange confusion of tongues, with one common
purpose binding all into one body, made the company
forming on the banks of the Peiho a wonderful one.</p>
<p>Thaine&#8217;s regiment was drawn up at an angle with the
line, ready to fall into its place among the reserves, and
the young Kansan watched the flower of the world&#8217;s soldiery
file along the way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_368' name='page_368'></a>368</span></p>
<p>In the front were the little brown Japanese Cavalry,
Artillery, and Infantry&mdash;men who in battle make dying as
much their business as living. Beside these were the English
forces, the Scotch Highlanders, the Welsh Fusiliers, the
Royal Artillery, all in best array. Behind them the Indian
Empire troops, the Sikh Infantry with a sprinkling of
Sepoys and the Mounted Bengalese Lancers. Then followed,
each in its place, the Italian marines and foot soldiery,
the well-groomed French troops from all branches
of the military; the stalwart, fair-haired Germans, soldiers
to a finish in weight and training; the Siberian Cossacks
and the Russian Infantry and Cavalry, big, brutal looking
men whom women of any nation might fear. In reserve at
the last of the line were the American forces, the Ninth
and Fourteenth Regiments of Infantry, the Sixth Cavalry,
and F Battery of the Fifth Artillery.</p>
<p>So marched the host from Tien-Tsin along the sandy
plains, led on by one purpose, to reach the old city of
Peking and save the lives of the foreign citizens shut up
inside their compound&mdash;whether massacred, or living,
starved, and tortured, this allied army then could not
know.</p>
<p>The August day was intensely hot, with its hours made
grievous by a heavy, humid air, and the sand and thick
dust ground and flung up in clouds by sixteen thousand
troops, with all the cavalry hoofs and artillery wheels. It
was only a type of the ten days that followed, wherein heat
and dust and humid air, and thirst&mdash;burning, maddening
thirst&mdash;joined together against the brave soldiery fighting
not for fortune, nor glory, nor patriotism, but for
humanity.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_369' name='page_369'></a>369</span></p>
<p>As they tramped away in military order, Thaine Aydelot
said to his nearest comrade:</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodrich, I saw a familiar German face up in the line.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Friend of yours the Emperor sent out to keep you
company?&#8221; Goodrich inquired with a smile.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, a Kansas joint-keeper named Hans Wyker. What
do you suppose put him against the Boxers?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the army is the last resort for some men. It&#8217;s
society&#8217;s clearing house,&#8221; Goodrich replied.</p>
<p>The speaker was a Harvard man, a cultured gentleman,
in civil life a University Professor. The same high purpose
was in his service that controlled Thaine Aydelot now.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like being at the tail-end of this procession,&#8221;
a big German from the Pennsylvania foundries declared,
as he trudged sturdily along under the blazing sun. The
courage in his determined face and his huge strength would
warrant him a place in the front line anywhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor I, Schwoebel,&#8221; Thaine declared. &#8220;I came out
with Funston&#8217;s &#8217;Fighting Twentieth.&#8217; I&#8217;m used to being
called back, not tolled along after the rear.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rock Chalk! Jay Hawk! K U!&#8221; roared Schwoebel
in a tremendous bellow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rock Chalk! Jay Hawk! K U!&#8221; a Pennsylvania
University man named McLearn followed Schwoebel.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rock Chalk! Jay Hawk! K U!&#8221; went down the
whole line of infantry.</p>
<p>The old Kansas University yell, taken to the Philippines
by college men, became the battle cry of the Twentieth
Kansas Volunteers, who when they returned to civil life, left
it there for the American, army&mdash;and &#8220;Rock Chalk! Jay
Hawk! K U!&#8221; became the American watchword and cry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_370' name='page_370'></a>370</span>
of all that &#8220;far flung battle line&#8221; marching on through
dust and heat to rescue the imperiled Christians in a beleagured
fortress inside the impregnable city of Peking.</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t worry about the rear, Aydelot. One
engagement may whip this line about, end to end, or it
may scale off all that&#8217;s in front of us and leave nothing
but the rear. All this before we have time to change collars
again. We&#8217;ll let you or Tasker here lead into Peking,&#8221;
an Indiana University man declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good of you, Binford. Some Kansas man will
be first to carry the flag into Peking. It might as well
be Aydelot.&#8221;</p>
<p>This from Tasker, a slender young fellow from a Kansas
railroad office.</p>
<p>So they joked as they tramped along. It was nearly
midnight when they pitched camp before the little village
of Peit-Tsang beside the Peiho.</p>
<p>In the dim dawning of the August morning Little Kemper&#8217;s
bugle sounded the morning reveille. Thaine was just
dreaming of home and he thought the first bugle note was
the call for him up the stairway of the Sunflower Inn.
His windows looked out on the Aydelot wheatfields and the
grove beyond, and every morning the sunrise across the
level eastern prairie made a picture only the hand of the
Infinite could paint. This morning he opened his eyes on
a far different scene. The reveille became a call to arms
and the troops fell into line ready for battle.</p>
<p>Before the sun had reached the zenith the line was
whipped end to end, as Binford of Indiana had said it
might be. In this engagement on the sandy plain about
the little village of Peit-Tsang, Thaine with his comrades
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_371' name='page_371'></a>371</span>
saw what it meant to lead that battle line. He saw the
brave little Japanese mowed down like standing grain before
the reaper&#8217;s sickle. He saw the ranks move swiftly up to
take the places of the fallen, never wavering nor retreating,
rushing to certain death as to places of vantage in a coronal
pageantry. The Filipino&#8217;s Mauser was as deadly as the
older style gun of the Boxer. A bullet aimed true does a
bullet&#8217;s work. But in this battle that raged about Peit-Tsang
Thaine quickly discovered that this was no fight in
a Filipino jungle. Here was real war, as big and terrible
above the campaigns he had known in Luzon as the purpose
in it was big above loyalty to the flag and extension of
American dominion and ideals.</p>
<p>When the thing was ended with the routing of the
Boxer forces, of the sixteen thousand that went into battle
a tithe of one-tenth of their number lay dead on the plains&mdash;sixteen
hundred men, the cost of conquest in a far
wilderness. The heaviest toll fell on the brave Japanese
who had led in the attack.</p>
<p>Thaine Aydelot did not dream of home that night. He
slept on his arms the heavy sleep of utter weariness, which
Little Kemper&#8217;s bugle call broke at three o&#8217;clock the next
morning. Before the August sun had crawled over the
eastern horizon the armies were swinging up the Peiho
river toward Peking. The American troops were leading
the column now, as Thaine Aydelot had wished they might,
and in all that followed after the day at Peit-Tsang the
Stars and Stripes, brave token of a brave people, floated
above the front lines of soldiery, even to the end of the
struggle.</p>
<p>It was high noon above the Orient, where the Peiho
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_372' name='page_372'></a>372</span>
flows beside the populous town of Yang-Tsun. The Boxer
army routed by the battle of Peit-Tsang had massed its
front before the town, a formidable array in numbers,
equipment, and frenzied eagerness to halt here and forever
the poor little line of foreign soldiers creeping in upon it
from the sea. The Boxers knew that they could match
the fighting strength of this line with quadruple force.
The troops coming toward them had marched twelve miles
under the August heat of a hundred degrees, through sand
and alkali dust, in the heavy humid air saturated with evil
odors. They had had no food since the night before, nor
a drink of water since daydawn. Joyful would it be to
slaughter here the entire band and then rush back to the
hoary old City of Peking with the triumphant message
that the Allied Armies of the World had fallen before
China. Then the death of every foreigner in the Empire
would be certain.</p>
<p>At noon the battle lines were formed. In the swinging
into place as Thaine Aydelot stood beside Tasker, surrounded
by his comrades, Little Kemper dashed by him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where the corn-fed Kansans do their work,&#8221; he
said gaily to the Kansas men.</p>
<p>&#8220;With a few bean-eaters from Boston to help,&#8221; Goodrich
responded.</p>
<p>&#8220;And a Hoosier to give them culture,&#8221; Binford added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, with the William Penn Quakers and the
Pennsylvania Dutch,&#8221; Schwoebel roared, striking McLearn
on the shoulder.</p>
<p>Men think of many things as the battle breaks, but
never do they fight less bravely because they have laughed
the moment before.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_373' name='page_373'></a>373</span></p>
<p>Thaine was in the very front of the battle lines. In
the pause before the first onslaught he thought of many
things confusedly and a few most vividly. He thought of
Leigh Shirley and her childish dream of Prince Quippi in
China&mdash;the China just beyond the purple notches. He
thought of his mother as she had looked that spring morning
when he talked of enlisting for the Spanish War. He
thought of his father, who had never known fear in his
life. Of his last words:</p>
<p>&#8220;As thy days so shall thy strength be.&#8221;</p>
<p>And keenly he remembered Dr. Carey, somewhere among
the troops behind him. The fine head crowned with white
hair, caressed by the moonbeams, as he had seen it in the
Manila garden, and his earnest words:</p>
<p>&#8220;You must learn to be a Christian. You must know
what service for humanity means. You need not hunt for
the opportunity to prove this. The opportunity is hurrying
toward you now out of the Unknown.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is here, the opportunity,&#8221; he murmured. &#8220;Oh, God,
make me a fit soldier for Thy service.&#8221;</p>
<p>He did not pray for safety from danger and death; he
asked for fitness to serve and in that moment his great
lesson was learned. There came an instant&#8217;s longing for
Dr. Carey; then the battle storm burst and he did not
think any more, he fought. It were useless to picture that
struggle.</p>
<p>Nothing counts in warfare till the results are shown.
For six hours the fighting did not cease, and not at
Valley Forge, nor Brandywine, Lake Erie, nor Buena
Vista, Gettysburg, nor Shiloh, San Juan Hill, nor in any
jungle in Luzon did the American flag stream out over
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_374' name='page_374'></a>374</span>
greater heroes than it led today on the plains beside the
Peiho river before Yang-Tsun.</p>
<p>At last the firing ceased, the smoke lifted above the field;
the Boxers, gathering their shattered forces together, retreated
again before the little line of Allied Troops invading
this big strange land. And the last hours of that long
hot day waned to eventide.</p>
<p>There were only a few of its events that Thaine could
comprehend. He knew Little Kemper had received his
death wound, blowing his bugle calls again and again after
he had been stricken, till the last reveille sounded for him.
The plucky little body with the big soul, who had found
his brief fifteen years of life so full of &#8220;doing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine knew that in the thick of the fight the native
Indian Infantry, the Sikhs and Sepoys, had fallen in
cowardly fear before the Boxer fire. He remembered how
big Schwoebel, and Tasker, and Binford, Goodrich, and
McLearn, with himself and another man whom he recalled
afterward as Boehringer, a Kansas man, had clubbed self-respect
into a few of them and kicked the other whining
cowards from their way. He knew that Schwoebel had
been grievously wounded and was being taken back to Tien-Tsin
with many other brave fellows who had been stricken
that day. He knew that near the last of the fray a man
whom he had admired and loved second to Lieutenant
Alford, big Clint Graham, of a royally fine old family of
state builders in far-away Kansas, had fallen by the
mistaken shot of Russian cannon, and the weight of that
loss hung heavy about the edge of his consciousness
wherever he turned. But what followed the battle Thaine
Aydelot will never forget.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_375' name='page_375'></a>375</span></p>
<p>Twelve hundred men rose no more from that bloody
field before Yang-Tsun. The fighting force, sixteen thousand
strong, was wearing off at the rate of almost a
regiment and a half a day, and it was yet a hundred miles
to Peking.</p>
<p>All about Thaine were men with faces grimy as his own;
their lips, like his, split and purple from the alkali dust.
They had had no water to drink in all that long day&#8217;s
twelve miles of marching and six hours of fighting. Fearful
is the price paid out when the wilderness goes forth to
war! And heroic, sublimely heroic, may be the Christianity
of the battlefield.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must help these fellows,&#8221; Thaine said to his
comrades as the wail for water went up from wounded
men.</p>
<p>&#8220;The river is this way,&#8221; McLearn declared. &#8220;Hurry!
the boys are dying.&#8221;</p>
<p>So over countless forms they hurried to the river&#8217;s
brink for water. Thaine and Tasker and Boehringer were
accustomed to muddy streams, for the prairie waters are
never clear. But Goodrich from Boston had a memory of
mountain brooks. The Pennsylvania man, McLearn, the
cold springs of the Alleghanies, and for Binford there was
old Broad Ripple out beyond Indianapolis. All these men
came down with dry canteens to the Peiho by Yang-Tsun.
The river was choked with dead Chinamen and dead dogs
and horses. They must push aside the bodies to find room
to dip in their canteens.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>&#8220;You have one more lesson. You must learn to be a
Christian.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_376' name='page_376'></a>376</span></p>
<p>Somehow the words seemed to ring round and round just
out of Thaine&#8217;s mental sight.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vasser! Vasser!&#8221; cried a big German soldier before
him.</p>
<p>Thaine stooped to give him a drink, and as he lifted up
the man&#8217;s head he saw the stained face of Hans Wyker.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very goot,&#8221; Hans murmured, licking his lips for
more. &#8220;Wisky not so goot as vasser,&#8221; and then he trailed
off into a delirium. &#8220;Don&#8217;t tell. Don&#8217;t tell,&#8221; he pleaded.
&#8220;I neffer mean to get Schmitt. I not know he would be
der yet. I hide for Yacob, an&#8217; I get Schmitt in der back
and I only want Yacob. He send me to der pen for sure yet
next time. I hate Yon Yacob.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little silence, then Hans murmured:</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t go to Kansas City. I coom back to Gretchen&#8217;s
home by Little Wolf. I hide where I watch for Yacob.
I shoot twice to be sure of Yacob, an&#8217; Schmitt, hidin&#8217; in
der crack by der roat, get one shot. So I coom to Yermany
and enlist. Gretchen, she coom too an&#8217; she stay der. Vell!
I help fight Boxer some. Mine Gott, forgif me. I do
once some goot for der world dis day.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that was the last of Wyker.</p>
<p>The twilight hour was near. The wounded had been
borne away by busy Red Cross angels of mercy. Wide
away across the Chinese plain the big red sun slipped down
the amber summer sky into a bath of molten flame. Then
out of sight behind the edge of the world it turned all
the west into one magnificent surge of scarlet glory, touching
to beauty the tiny gray cloud flecks far away to the
eastward; while long rivers of golden light by rivers of
roseate glow mingled at last along the zenith in one vast
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_377' name='page_377'></a>377</span>
sweep of mother-of-pearl. A cool breeze came singing in
from the sea&mdash;fanning the fevered faces of the weary
soldiers. The desolate places were hidden by the deepening
shadows, and the serenity of the twilight hour fell
on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Then the men of each nationality went out to bury their
dead. Swiftly the little brown Japanese digged and filled
up the graves into which their comrades were deftly heaped.
The Russian and Siberian Cossack lunged their fallen ones
in heavily and unfeelingly. The Bengalese and Sikhs thrust
their own out of sight as they were planting for an uncertain
harvest. Each soldier from France who lost his life
on that battlefield fell on his own grave and there his
countrymen covered him over, an unmarked spot in a
foreign land.</p>
<p>Thaine straightened a minute above his spade. The
cool breezes were grateful to his heated brow. The after-sunset
glow seemed like the benediction of the Infinite on
the closing act of the day. He saw the hurried and unfeeling
dumping of bodies into the holes awaiting them.
Then his heart grew big with something unspeakable as he
noted how in all that irreverent and unsympathetic action
the American and English soldiery alone were serving as
brother for brother. In the long trenches prepared for
them their dead were laid with reverent dignity and gentleness.
Each one&#8217;s place was carefully marked with a numbered
slab that in a future day the sacred dust might be
carried back to the soil of the homeland. As the sunset
deepened to richer coloring and the battlefield grew still
and still, far along the lines the bands of the English
Royal Artillery and the Welsh Fusiliers, with the bagpipes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_378' name='page_378'></a>378</span>
of the Scottish Highlanders, mingled their music with the
music of the splendid band of the Fourteenth American
Infantry in the sweet and sacred strains of the beloved old
hymn:</p>

<p>The victory at Yang-Tsun had come with a tremendous
loss of life. To go on now promised the cutting to
pieces of the entire army. To stay here and await reinforcements
would mean the slaughter of all the foreigners
in Peking. In a council of war the next day English and
Indian, Russian, German, Japanese, Italian, and French,
general after general declared for the wisdom of waiting
at Yang-Tsun for reinforcements.</p>
<p>Up spoke then General Chaffee of the American
command:</p>
<p>&#8220;I will not wait while the Boxers massacre the helpless
Christians. Stay here or go back to your own countries,
as you please. My army will go on to Peking, if it must
go alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>And his will prevailed.</p>
<p>Followed then a memorable march, with the Stars and
Stripes ever leading the line. The strength of the force
was thirteen thousand now and one thousand of these fell
by the way before the end of the journey.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_380' name='page_380'></a>380</span></p>
<p>After Yang-Tsun, for the only time in this ten days&#8217;
campaign, the soldiers undressed and bathed themselves like
Christians in the unchristian Peiho, and on the next day,
which was the Sabbath, they listened to the military chapel
service. Six days they forged onward with the same cruel
heat, and scalding air, and alkali dust, and poison water,
over dreary plains, through deserted villages, twenty,
twenty-five, and even thirty miles a day, they pushed on
toward the Chinese capital.</p>
<p>And ever before them the Boxers slowly receded, stinging
grievously as they moved. Sure were they that at last only
dire calamity could await that slender column moving across
the plains, led under a flag of red, white, and blue, with
bands ever playing <i>The Star-Spangled Banner</i>, while from
line on line rolled out that weird battle cry of &#8220;Rock
Chalk! Jay Hawk! K U!&#8221; Sure were they that this
stubborn little bands of soldiers foolishly following the
receding Boxer must at last crush itself like dead-ripe fruit
against the ancient and invincible walls of Peking.</p>
<p>On the evening of the sixth day from Yang-Tsun the
twelve thousand men of the Allied Armies, flower of the
world&#8217;s soldiery, stumbled into camp with their outposts
in sight of the great walls of the City of Peking. This
had been the longest and hottest of all the days, with the
weariest length of march. A great storm cloud was rising
in the west and the air hung hot and still before it.</p>
<p>Thaine Aydelot and his comrades threw themselves down,
too exhausted to care for what might happen next.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the hottest day I ever knew,&#8221; declared McLearn
wearily, as he lay prone on the ground looking up at the
hot sky with unblinking eyes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_381' name='page_381'></a>381</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon you never hit the National pike on an August
day, out between Green Castle and Terre Haute down in
Indianny,&#8221; Binford suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nor St. Marys-by-the-Kaw,&#8221; Boehringer, a Kansas
man, added. &#8220;There&#8217;s where you get real summery
weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, kill him, Aydelot, he&#8217;s worse than a Boxer. Don&#8217;t
you know I&#8217;m from Boston originally, which is only a
State of Mind?&#8221; Goodrich urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;No matter what state you are from originally, you
are in China now, which is in a state of insurrection that
we must get ready for a state of resurrection tomorrow.
What are you thinking about, T. Aydelot? You look like
Moses and the prophets.&#8221; McLearn half turned over
with the question.</p>
<p>Thaine, who was lying on his side, supporting his head
on his hand, quoted softly:</p>

<p>A low boom of thunder rolled across the western sky; a
twilight darkness fell on the earth, and a long night of
storm and stress began for the army of deliverance
encamped before Peking.</p>
<p>Outside the city the Boxers massed in numbers. Inside
more than a hundred thousand waited the coming of hardly
more than one-tenth of their number. No wonder they
felt secure behind their centuries-old walls.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_382' name='page_382'></a>382</span></p>
<p>Thaine Aydelot was accustomed to sleeping tentless on
the ground and to being beaten by rains. He was a sound
sleeper and he was very weary. But tonight he could not
sleep. The morrow would see world movements that should
change all future history; in which movements he was a
tiny unit, as every furrow that his father, Asher Aydelot,
had run across the face of the prairie had by so much won
it from wilderness to fruitfulness.</p>
<p>All night long the rain poured in torrents upon the camp.
A terrific cannonade of thunder shook the earth. The
lightning tore through the clouds in jagged tongues of
flame. Where Thaine lay he could see with every flash
the great frowning black walls of Peking looming up only
a few miles away. In the lull of the thunder a more dreadful
cannonading could be heard, hour after hour. Thaine
knew that inside the walls the Boxers were besieging the
Compound. And inside that Compound, if he were yet
alive, was his old teacher, Pryor Gaines. He wondered if
the God of Battles that had led the armies all this long
hard way would fail them now when one more blow might
bring deliverance to His children. He remembered again
the blessing with which his father had sent him forth:</p>
<p>&#8220;As thy day so shall thy strength be. The Eternal God
is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.&#8221;</p>
<p>The memory brought peace, and at length, wrapped
round in the blessing of an absolute trust, he fell asleep.</p>
<p>Inside of the City of Peking on that dreadful night the
madness of the Boxer forces was comparable to nothing
human. Nor jungle beasts starving for food and drink,
frenzied with the smell of blood and the sight of water,
could have raged in more maniac fury than the fury
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_383' name='page_383'></a>383</span>
possessing the demon minds of these fanatics in their supreme
struggle to flood the streets of Peking with rivers of
Christian blood. For such as these the Christ died on the
Cross of Calvary. For such as these the missionary is
offered up. A human jungle, untamed and waiting, to
whose wilderness the soldier became a light-bearer, albeit
he brought the gospel of gunpowder to aid him.</p>
<p>The great walls about Peking enclose an area some fourteen
miles in length and twelve miles in width. Within
these walls lie several cities, separated from each other by
walls of lesser strength, intended, with one exception, in
the opening of the twentieth century, not so much for
defense as for boundary lines.</p>
<p>The exception is the Imperial City, inside whose sacred
precincts it was firmly believed a foreigner might not set
foot and not be stricken dead by the gods. This City
within a city had defenses the allied armies were yet to
come against. It lies on the north, inside the great wall.
Just east of it, along the north wall, was the Foreign
Legation, whose south and east bounds were lesser structures
of brick and earth. Here all the foreigners and many
native Christians had been shut in for six long weeks, with
the infuriated Boxers hammering daily at their gates, mad
for massacre.</p>
<p>Here they had barricaded themselves with all the meager
means available. They had fortified every gate with whatever
might stop a bullet or check a cannon ball. They filled
up the broken places in the walls with piles of earth; they
dug deep trenches inside these walls, and inside these
trenches they had built up heaps of earthworks. Daily
they strengthened the weaker places and watched and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_384' name='page_384'></a>384</span>
prayed. No word from the big world outside seemingly
could come to them&mdash;a little handful of the Lord&#8217;s children,
forgotten of Him, and locked dungeon deep from human
aid. They had sent out a cry for help and had sent up
prayers for deliverance. How far that cry had gone they
could not know. Frowning walls besieged by enemies lay
all around them. They could only look up and lift up helpless
hands in prayer to the hot, unpitying August skies
above them. Sickness stalked in over the walls. Hunger
tore its way through the gates. Death swooped down, and
sorrow seeped up, and despair lay in wait. But hope, and
trust, and faith, and love failed not.</p>
<p>They ate dogs and horses. They went half naked that
they might make sand bags of their clothes for greater
defense. They exhausted every means for protection and
life, but they forgot not to pray.</p>
<p>On this August night, while unknown to the besieged
the Allied Armies encamped only six miles away, the reign
of terror reached its height for the little Christian stronghold.</p>
<p>The storm beat pitilessly on the starved and ragged
captives. The rain softened the earthworks and the rivers
of water in the trenches threatened to undermine the walls.
Across these walls the incessant attack of cannon and roar
of rifles was beyond anything the six weeks&#8217; siege had
known, and only the power of Omnipotence could stay the
bloody hands. So the long hours of the dreadful night
dragged on.</p>
<p>At length came daydawn. The storm had rolled away.
A lull in the besieging guns gave the Legation a little
rest of mind. Hungry and helpless, it waited the passing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_385' name='page_385'></a>385</span>
of another day. A silence seemed to fill the city and the
wiser ones wondered anxiously what it might portend.</p>
<p>Suddenly, in the midst of it, a great gun boomed out
to the northeast. Another gun, and another. Then came
a pause and the besieged listened eagerly, for their own
walls felt no shock. Again came the bellow of cannon,
nearer and heavier, repeated and repeated, and the roll of
smoke and the rattling fusillade of bullet shots told that a
battle was on. Outside the gates! An army come against
Peking! The Army of Deliverance! They were here fighting
for the Christians! Oh, the music of birds&#8217; song, of rippling
waters, of gently pulsing zephyrs, the music of old
cathedral chimes, of grandest orchestras&mdash;nothing of them
all could sound so like to the music that the morning stars
sang together as this deafening peal of cannon, this rippling
rhythm of Krag rifles.</p>
<p>With bursting hearts they waited and watched the great
wall to the north. It is sixty feet high and fully as wide
at its base, tapering to twenty-five feet across the top.
Could the gates be stormed? Could this wall be shaken?
From the highest points inside the Compound eager eyes
scanned the northeast as the battle raged on with crash
of shells and whir of bullets. Then down to the waiting
ones came a message that seemed to fly to every ear in the
besieged city, making men and women drop to the ground
in a very ecstasy of joy.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve run up the Stars and Stripes on the northeast
wall!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sword of the Lord and of Gideon was come again
to Peking, as it came once long ago to the Valley of
Jezreel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_386' name='page_386'></a>386</span></p>
<p>The Allied Armies broke camp early on the morning of
August fourteen in the year of nineteen hundred. Six
miles away stood the most impassable defense an army of
the West might ever storm. Yet the twelve thousand men
did not hesitate. With General Chaffee&#8217;s troops in the front
of the line they fought through fiercely skirmishing forces
up to the hoary old city&#8217;s gates, the Fourteenth United
States Infantry leading the way. The American guns
cleared the Chinese soldiery from the top of the walls, and
the American cannon were in line ready to blow open the
huge gates.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to know what&#8217;s on the other side before I open
up the gates,&#8221; General Chaffee declared.</p>
<p>So the command was given for a volunteer to scale the
wall, to stand up a target for the Chinese rifles! To
be blown to pieces by Chinese cannon! Yet the armies
must know what awaited them. There must be no debouching
into a death-trap for a wholesale massacre.</p>
<p>Thaine Aydelot had cherished one hope since the twilight
hour on the battlefield at Yang-Tsun&mdash;that when this day
should come the American might lead the way through the
Peking gates and be first to enter the strange old city.
Not merely because he was an American patriot, but because
to him the American soldiers with all their sins and follies
of youth and military life were yet world missionaries.</p>
<p>Thaine knew his comrades shared his hope, whether for
the same high purpose he could not have asked. He had
no longer dreams of military glory for himself. His joy
was in achievement, no matter by whose hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s an order for somebody to go up on the wall.&#8221;</p>
<p>The word was passed along the line. Before it reached
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_387' name='page_387'></a>387</span>
Thaine and his comrades a young soldier had leaped forward
to obey the order.</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory be, America first!&#8221; Goodrich said fervently.</p>
<p>&#8220;And a Kansan. A Jayhawker!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine did not know who said it. He saw the soldier,
young Calvin Titus, a Kansas boy, leap after the Japanese
coolies who ran forward toward the wall with the long
bamboo scaling ladders. And for one instant&#8217;s flash of
time the old level prairies came sweeping into view, the
winding line of Grass River with the sand dunes beyond;
the wheat fields, the windbreaks, the sunflowers beside the
trail, and far away the three headlands veiled in the golden
haze of an August morning. A Kansas boy the hero of
the day&mdash;first of all that army to stand on top of that
hoary old wall! The prairies had grown another name
for the annals of history.</p>
<p>Before him were the little brown coolies holding the
ladder, and up its slender swaying height, round by round,
went young Titus nimbly as a squirrel up a cottonwood
limb.</p>
<p>The Kansas men went wild.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rock Chalk! Jay Hawk! K U! oo!&#8221; they shouted
again and again, ending in the long quavering wail as the
University yell must always end.</p>
<p>Up and up went Titus, sixty feet, to the top of the wall.
Then as he stood above the strange old Oriental city, rilled
now with frenzied fighters; above the poor starving Christians
in their Compound&mdash;saved as by a miracle; above
the twelve thousand soldiers sent hither from the far homelands
beyond the seas to rescue human beings from deadly
peril. As he stood over all these, a target for a hundred
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_388' name='page_388'></a>388</span>
guns, the khaki-clad young Kansan lifted his right hand
high above his head and swung out the Stars and Stripes
to all the breezes of that August morning.</p>
<p>Then came the belching of cannon, the bursting of
huge timbers, the groaning of twisting iron, and through
the splintered gates the Allied Armies had entered the
city.</p>
<p>Inside the walls the hundred thousand Boxers renewed
the strife. The walls and gates of the Foreign Legation
were as stubbornly defended by the Chinese fanatics on the
outside now as the besieged Christians had defended them
against the Chinese on the inside. Entrance was made at
last through the sluiceway, or open sewer, draining out
under the city walls.</p>
<p>It was a strange looking line of creatures who came
crawling, waist-deep in filth, through the sewer&#8217;s channel.
The old Aydelot sense of humor had saved Thaine many
a time. And he wondered afterward if he had not seen by
chance the ludicrous picture of himself in a huge mirror,
if his heart would not have burst with grief when Pryor
Gaines came toward him, mute and pallid, with outstretched
hands.</p>
<p>The little group of soldiers who had fought and
marched together had not had off their clothes for seven
days. A stubby two weeks&#8217; beard was on each face. Their
feet were raw from hard marching. Rain and dust and
mud and powder smoke had trimmed their uniforms, and
now the baptism by immersion in the Compound sewer had
given them the finishing touches. But the gaunt-faced men
and women, the pitiful, big-eyed children, whose emaciated
forms told the tale of the six weeks&#8217; imprisonment, made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_389' name='page_389'></a>389</span>
them forget themselves as these poor rescued Christians
hugged and kissed their brave rescuers.</p>
<p>Thaine hadn&#8217;t kissed any woman except his mother since
the evening when he and Leigh Shirley had lingered on
the Purple Notches in a sad-sweet moment of separation.
It lifted the pressure crushing round his heart when he
saw Goodrich, with shining eyes, bending to let a poor little
missionary stroke his grimy cheek.</p>
<p>The Boxers retired by degrees before the superior force,
entrenching themselves inside the Imperial City. Never in
its history, centuries on centuries old, had this Imperial
City&#8217;s sacred precincts been defiled by foreign feet. Here
the Boxer felt himself secure. Here the gods of his fathers
would permit no foreigner to enter. On these hoary old
walls no Christian would dare to stand. On three sides
of the Imperial City these walls were invincible. The
fourth was equipped with six heavy gates.</p>
<p>In a council of the powers the impossibility of storming
these gates was fully made clear. The number of soldiers
was carefully estimated&mdash;American, Japanese, Russian,
German, French, and Italian, Sikh and Sepoy, Bengalese,
Scotchman, Welsh, and Royal Englishmen. All had suffered
heavily in this campaign. None more grievously than
the American.</p>
<p>The decision of the council was overwhelming that the
Imperial City could not be taken by this little force
outside its battlements. Only General Chaffee protested
against giving up the attempt.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can your men take those walls?&#8221; The query came
from the leaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;My men can take hell,&#8221; General Chaffee replied, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_390' name='page_390'></a>390</span>
less of profanity than of truth in his terms. And the
attempt was given over to the Americans.</p>
<p>One of the six gates stood wide open, a death-trap laid
by the wily Boxer, believing that the foreign forces would
rush through it to be shot down like rats in a hole. Beyond
it was a paved court some five hundred yards wide, reaching
up to a second wall, equipped likewise with six great gates.</p>
<p>Thaine&#8217;s company was singled out to go inside the open
gate and draw the Boxer fire toward themselves while the
American army stormed the closed gates. The little group
of men lay flat on the pavement, defending themselves and
harassing the enemy. They knew why they had been sent
in, but they were seasoned soldiers. Thaine looked down
the line of less than a hundred men, McLearn, and
Boehringer, Tasker, Goodrich, and Binford, all were in
that line. He felt a thrill of soldier pride as he said to
himself:</p>
<p>&#8220;We are fit. They have chosen us for the sacrifice.
We&#8217;ll prove ourselves.&#8221; Then he thought of nothing else
but duty all that day.</p>
<p>The capture of the first wall opened the way to a second
with a paved court beyond it, and beyond that lay a third,
and a fourth, and a fifth; wall and court, wall and court,
through which, and across which the American army forced
its way by heaviest bombarding under heaviest fire, leaving
a clean rear for the other armies to follow in. Only the
sixth and last wall remained. General Chaffee&#8217;s men had
not failed. The flag of red, white, and blue had led
steadily on &#8217;mid a storm of shells and a deluge of bullets.</p>
<p>One more onslaught and the last gates would burst wide
open. Eagerly the American soldiers waited the command
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_391' name='page_391'></a>391</span>
to finish the task. But it was not given. The leaders of
the other armies had counseled together and prevailed
against further advance, whether moved by military prudence
or governed by jealousy of the ability of General
Chaffee and the magnificent record of the American soldiers
in the Orient, the privates could not know.</p>
<p>Just as the command to retire was sounded Japanese
coolies had run with scaling ladders to the last wall. It
was the supreme moment for Thaine Aydelot. He was only
a private, but in that instant all the old dominant Cavalier
blood of the Thaines, all the old fearless independence of
the Huguenot Aydelots, all the calm poise and courage of
the Quaker Penningtons throbbed again in his every pulse-beat.
He threw aside his soldier obligation and stood up
a man, guided alone by the light within him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a far cry from the green Kansas prairies to the
heart of old China,&#8221; he declared to himself. &#8220;Yet I&#8217;ll go
to the heart of that heart now, and I&#8217;ll show it the Stars
and Stripes of a free people, so help me God!&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and sped to the last wall, snatching the flag
from a color-bearer as he ran. At the foot of the ladder
the men holding it wavered a little. Thaine threw the flag
up to a coolie who was already climbing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Take it up. If I don&#8217;t get up, wave it there if you
die for it,&#8221; he cried as he sprang up the ladder behind the
color-bearer.</p>
<p>The shots were thick about them as up and up they went
until at last Thaine stood beside the indomitable little
Japanese who had carried the American flag up the ladder.</p>
<p>Below the Kansas boy lay the holy city of an ancient
civilization in all its breadth of ingenuity and narrowness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_392' name='page_392'></a>392</span>
of spirit. Standing there, a target for every gun, waving
the Star-Spangled Banner out over that old stronghold, he
cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the end of the wilderness! Look up and see
the token of light and hope and love. Other hands than
mine will bear them to you, but I have shown you their
symbol. I, Thaine Aydelot, of Kansas, first of all the
world, have dared to stand on your most sacred walls with
Old Glory in my hand. Wherever its shadow falls there is
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In God&#8217;s good
time they will all come to you in peace as they have come
to you now in warfare. Mine today has been the soldier
service, and mine today the great reward.&#8221;</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>Thaine Aydelot sat with Doctor Carey and Pryor Gaines
in the latter&#8217;s home in the Foreign Compound in Peking.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done my work here,&#8221; Pryor was saying. &#8220;I
have only one wish&mdash;to go back to old Grass River in
Kansas and spend my days with Jim Shirley. We two will
both live to be old because we are useless; and Leigh will
be marrying one of these times, if the Lord ever made a
man good enough for her. So Jim and I can chum along
down the years together.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the place for you, Pryor,&#8221; Doctor Carey asserted.
&#8220;And now that the ranch is making money while Jim
sleeps, you two will be happy and busy as bees. Every
neighborhood needs a man or two without family ties.
You&#8217;ll be the most useful citizens in that corner of the
prairies. And think of eating Jim Shirley&#8217;s cooking after
this.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_394' name='page_394'></a>394</span></p>
<p>&#8220;And you, Thaine? What now?&#8221; Pryor asked as he
looked fondly at the young battle-tried soldier.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have done my work here,&#8221; Thaine quoted his words.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve only one wish&mdash;to go back to old Grass River in
Kansas to take my place on the prairie and win the soil
to its best uses; to do as good a work as my father has
done.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine&#8217;s dark eyes were luminous with hopefulness, and
if a line of pathos for a loss in his life that nothing could
fill had settled about his firm mouth, it took nothing from
the manliness of the strong young face.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you, Carey?&#8221; Pryor asked.</p>
<p>Doctor Carey did not reply at once. A strange weariness
had crept over his countenance, and a far-away look
was in his eyes. The man who had forgotten himself in
his service for others was coming swiftly toward his reward.
But neither of his friends noted the change now.
At last he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Years ago I loved a girl as I never could care for
any other girl. She would have loved me sooner or later
if something hadn&#8217;t happened. A message from the man
she cared for most fell into my hands one day long ago:
a withered flower and a little card. I could have kept them
back and won her for my wife, but I didn&#8217;t. I sent the
message to her by a servant boy&mdash;and she has been happy
always in her love.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doctor Carey turned his face away for the moment.
Thaine Aydelot&#8217;s eyes were so much like Virginia Thaine&#8217;s
to him just then. Presently he went on:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes the thing we fail to get helps us to know
better how to live and to live happily. You will not be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_395' name='page_395'></a>395</span>
a coward, Thaine, when you come, year by year, to know
the greater wilderness inside yourself. You will go back
to the prairies where you belong, as you say, and you will
do a man&#8217;s part in the big world that&#8217;s always needing
men.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine recalled the evening hour when he and Leigh were
on the Purple Notches and he had declared in the pride of
his nineteen years that he wanted to go out into the big
world that is always needing men and do a man&#8217;s part
there.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the big world needs men anywhere, it is on the old
prairies,&#8221; he declared, and the doctor continued: &#8220;I have
found my future already. I shall not leave China again.
Grass River may miss me as a friend but not as a doctor
of medicine. Doctors are too plentiful there. My place
is here henceforth, and I&#8217;m still young. I came to the
Philippines to be with Thaine&#8221;&mdash;Horace Carey&#8217;s voice was
low, and the same old winning smile was on his face&mdash;&#8220;because
I love the boy and because I wanted to protect
him if it should be my fortune to do it. I saved him from
the waters of the Rio Grande and helped to pull him out
of the hospital at Manila. He doesn&#8217;t need me now,
for he goes to do a big work, and I stay here to do a
big work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Out of love for me alone?&#8221; Thaine asked affectionately,
throwing one arm about Horace Carey&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not you alone,&#8221; Carey answered frankly, &#8220;but
because something in your face always reminds me of a
face I loved long ago. Of one for whose sake I have cared
for you here. You are going home a brave man. I believe
your life will be full of service and of happiness.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_396' name='page_396'></a>396</span></p>
<p>The silence that followed was broken by Pryor Gaines
saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;All this time&mdash;such a tragical time&mdash;I have forgotten,
Thaine, that I have a message for you, a little package
that reached here late last May. It was sent to me because
the sender thought you were coming to China soon, and I
was asked to keep it for you. You didn&#8217;t come, and mails
ceased to leave Peking&mdash;and then came the siege, the
struggle to keep up the defenses, the sickness, the starvation,
the deaths, the constant attacks, the final sight of
Old Glory on the outer walls, and your triumphal entry
through the sewer. You see why I forgot.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took a little package from his writing desk and gave
it into Thaine Aydelot&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>The young soldier tried to open it with steady fingers,
for the address was in a handwriting he knew well. Inside
a flat little box was a card bearing the words:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'><span style='font-variant: small-caps'>To Prince Quippi, Beyond the Purple Notches.</span></p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>And underneath that lay a withered little yellow sunflower.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Two evenings later as the three men sat together, Horace
Carey suddenly gripped Thaine&#8217;s hand in his, then sank
back in his chair with eyes that seemed looking straight into
eternal peace; and the same smile that had won men to him
seemed winning the angels to welcome him heavenward. In
the midst of his busy, useful years his big work was done.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The sunflowers were just beginning to blossom along the
old Grass River Trail. The line of timber following every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_397' name='page_397'></a>397</span>
stream was in the full leafage of May. The wheat lay
like a yellow-green sea over all the wide prairies. The
breeze came singing down the valley, a morning song of
gladness.</p>
<p>Leigh Shirley had come up early to the Sunflower Ranch
to spend the day and night with Virginia Aydelot, while
Asher and her uncle Jim took a two days&#8217; business
trip to Big Wolf with Darley Champers. Jim had
brought Virginia a big bunch of exquisite roses which
nobody but Jim Shirley could ever have grown to such
perfection.</p>
<p>Virginia went into the house to find the tall cut-glass
vase Doctor Carey had sent to her when he started West,
while Leigh went to the gate of the side lot to pet a pretty
black colt that whinnied to her.</p>
<p>&#8220;You beautiful Juno!&#8221; she cried, patting the creature&#8217;s
nose. &#8220;Mrs. Aydelot says you are as graceful and well-bred
as all your grandmothers have been since the time
a Juno long ago followed a prairie schooner down the old
Grass River Trail to a little sod shack on a treeless claim
in the wilderness. This is too fine a morning to go indoors,&#8221;
she added as she came back to the front lawn to
the seat under the fragrant white honeysuckle.</p>
<p>She was as sweet as a blossom herself this morning, with
her soft brown-gold hair waving back from her face, and
her blue eyes full of light.</p>
<p>Somebody had turned from the road and was coming
up the walk with springing step. Leigh turned her head
to see who it might be, as she reached for a spray of the
fragrant honeysuckle, and found Thaine Aydelot standing
before her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_398' name='page_398'></a>398</span></p>
<p>With a glad cry, she dropped the blossoms and sprang
to her feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prince Quippi couldn&#8217;t come nor write, so he sent me.
Will I do for an answer, Leighlie? I was coming back to
the blessed old prairies, anyhow; to my father and mother
and the life of a farmer. I have come to see at last
through Asher Aydelot&#8217;s eyes that wars in any cause are
short-lived, and, even with a Christian soldiery, very brutal;
that after the wars come the empire-makers, who really
conquer, and that the man who patiently wins from the
soil its hundredfold of increase may be a king among men.
I can see such big things to be done here, but, oh, Leigh,
are you sure you want me here?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine was holding her hands in a gentle grip, looking
with love-hungry eyes down into her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always been sure I wanted you,&#8221; Leigh said softly,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ve always hoped you would come back here to the
prairies again. But, Thaine, I&#8217;m so proud of you, too,
for all the heroic things you have helped to do in the Philippines
and in China. I am glad now you did go for a
while. You have been a part of a history-making that
shall change all the future years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine put his arm about her and drew her close to him
as he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;ll go and build a house on the Purple Notches,
a purple velvet house with gold knobs, and all that yellow
prairie away to the west that was only grass land four
years ago we&#8217;ll turn to wheat fields like Asher Aydelot&#8217;s
here. John Jacobs was holding that ground for somebody
like you and me. We&#8217;ll buy it of his estate. We&#8217;ll
show the fathers what the sons can do.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_399' name='page_399'></a>399</span></p>
<p>A thrill of happiness lighted Leigh&#8217;s face for a moment,
then a shadow fell over it as she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Thaine, Darley Champers and I have kept a secret for
a year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You kept it &#8217;danged&#8217; well. What was it?&#8221; Thaine
asked gaily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jane Aydelot, who died last year, left me all her property,&#8221;
Leigh began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for Jennie,&#8221; Thaine broke in, but Leigh hurried
on.</p>
<p>&#8220;I always knew she meant to do it, and that was one
reason why I sent you away. I wouldn&#8217;t have your money
and I felt if you knew you wouldn&#8217;t ask me for fear I&#8217;d
think&mdash;Oh, money you don&#8217;t earn or inherit squarely is
such a grief,&#8221; Leigh paused.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you wouldn&#8217;t let me have any hope because of this
junk in Ohio that you were afraid you&#8217;d get and I&#8217;d seem
to be wanting if I married you, and you thought I ought
to have and you&#8217;d seem to be marrying me to get. If I
ever have an estate, I&#8217;ll leave it to foreign missions. I&#8217;d
like to make trouble for the cuss that got me at the Rio
Grande. Money might do it,&#8221; Thaine declared.</p>
<p>Leigh did not laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right, Thaine. I was so unhappy about it all.
For since I first came to Uncle Jim&#8217;s, I knew I ought not
have Miss Jane&#8217;s love and the farm that you would have
had if she knew you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve known this all these years and never told even
me. You silent little subsoiler!&#8221; Thaine exclaimed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It grew in my mind from an almost babyhood impression
to a woman&#8217;s principle,&#8221; Leigh declared. &#8220;I never
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_400' name='page_400'></a>400</span>
thought of telling anybody. But there was another thing
that kept me firm that day on the Purple Notches. Years
ago, when I was a baby girl, I remember dimly seeing two
men in an awful fight one night just at dusk down on the
railroad track by Clover Creek in Ohio. I thought one of
them was my father. Miss Jane would never tell me anything
about it, and made me promise never to speak of it.
So I grew up sure that my father had committed some
dreadful crime, and, Thaine, until I knew better, I couldn&#8217;t
take the risk of disgracing your name, the proud name of
Aydelot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Leigh, it is no matter what our forefathers do&mdash;they
were all a bad lot if we go back far enough. It&#8217;s
what we do that counts. It&#8217;s what I do as Thaine Aydelot,
not as Asher Aydelot&#8217;s son, that I must stand or fall by.
It&#8217;s how far we win our wilderness, little girl, not the wilderness
our fathers won or lost.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thaine was sitting beside Leigh now, under the perfumy
white honeysuckle blossoms.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Thaine, the bans are all lifted now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Leigh sat with face aglow. &#8220;Your grandfather wouldn&#8217;t
let his property go to a child of Virginia Aydelot, so
Miss Jane couldn&#8217;t give it to you. She left it to me&mdash;all
her property, provided, or hoping, I would&mdash;you
should&mdash;&#8221;she hesitated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we should, and we will,&#8221; Thaine finished the sentence.
&#8220;Bless her good soul! I&#8217;ve always been rather
fond of her, anyhow!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Darley Champers found out that my father was
accidentally drowned long ago in Clover Creek. Uncle Jim
says he never could swim, and so that burden is lifted. But,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_401' name='page_401'></a>401</span>
Thaine, will you want to go back to Ohio to the Aydelot
homestead? I could sell it for a club house to the Cloverdale
Country Club, but I waited till you should come, to
know what to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was just a little quaver in Leigh&#8217;s voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you want to go back to Ohio?&#8221; Thaine inquired.
&#8220;Unless you do, the country clubbers may have the place.
There is no homestead there for me. This is my homestead.
I want that open ranch-land beyond the Purple
Notches. But, Leigh, if my father as administrator and
trustee for John Jacobs&#8217; estate can sell me the ground
and your inheritance from Jane Aydelot pays for it, what
is there left for me to do after all? I can&#8217;t take favors and
give none. I&#8217;ll run away and enlist with the Regulars
first.&#8221;</p>
<p>A rueful look came over his face now, and behind the
words Leigh read a determined will.</p>
<p>&#8220;The real thing is left to you,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;the biggest
work of all. You must go out and tame the soil.
Your father bought his first quarter with money his father
had left him by will, but he had no inheritance to buy all
the other quarters that make the big Aydelot wheat fields
of the Sunflower Ranch. If every acre of the prairie was
covered with a layer of eastern capital, borrowed or inherited,
it would not make one stalk of wheat grow nor ripen
one ear of corn. But you may turn up the soil with your
plow and find silver dollars in the furrow. You may herd
cattle on the plains, and their dun hides will bring you
cloth-of-gold. You may seed the brown fields with alfalfa,
and it will take away the fear of protest or over-draft, as
the Coburn book says it will. I know, because I&#8217;ve tried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_402' name='page_402'></a>402</span>
and proved it. Oh, Thaine, with all your grand battles in
the East which is always our West, Luzon is still a jungle
and China isn&#8217;t yet in the light. You have only prepared
the way for the big things that are to follow. I never
hear the old Civil War veterans telling of their achievements
in a Grand Army meeting without wishing that, after
their great story is told, the Grand Army of the Prairies
would tell their tale of how the men and women fought out
the battles here with no music of drums nor roar of cannon,
nor bugle calls, nor shoulder straps, nor comradeship,
nor inspiring heroic climaxes, and straight, fierce campaigns
to victory. But just loneliness, and discouragements,
and long waiting, and big, foolish-seeming dreams
of what might be, with only the reality of the unfriendly
land to work upon. I&#8217;m so glad you want to stay here
and to take that open prairie beyond the Purple Notches
for our kingdom.&#8221;</p>
<p>The happiness in Leigh Shirley&#8217;s eyes took from
Thaine&#8217;s mind the memory of all the hardship and tragedy
of his two years on the battlefield. Her pride in his achievements,
her joy in his return and her dream of their future
together in a work so full of service, filled his soul with
rejoicing, as the May morning opened for these two its
paradise of Youth and Love.</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>Asher and Virginia Aydelot had come out on the veranda
to look for Leigh. A moment they waited, then Asher
said softly:</p>
<p>&#8220;He has forgotten us, but he has come back to the
life we love.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he will come back to us tenfold more ours, because
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_403' name='page_403'></a>403</span>
his heart is here,&#8221; Virginia answered, and the two stole
softly indoors.</p>
<p>&#8220;See the roses Jim brought; they seem to belong to
that beautiful vase,&#8221; Virginia said as they stood at the
door of the dining room. &#8220;I think Jim must have meant
them for Leigh and Thaine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, he brought us sunflowers in an old tin peach-can
wrapped with a newspaper, and we had no mahogany dining
room set and not so much cut-glass and china and
silver in our cupboard, nor quite such a good rug on our
hardwood floor,&#8221; Asher replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;But we had each other and the vision to see all these
things coming to us,&#8221; Virginia said as she looked up into
her husband&#8217;s face with love-lighted eyes. &#8220;I wonder where
Jim is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jim is present.&#8221; Jim Shirley came in quietly from the
side porch. &#8220;He prepared your wedding supper for you.
He buried your first-born, and now he comes to give you a
daughter, He&#8217;s been first aid to the Aydelots all along the
line, as he will hope to continue to be, world without end,
and a little more.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='tb' />

<p>The homestead on the Purple Notches looks out on a
level land stretching away in an unbroken line to the far
westward horizon. Broad fields of wheat grow golden in the
summer sunshine, and acres of dark alfalfa perfume the
air above them. With a clearer vision of what reward farm
life may bring for him who goes forth and earns that
reward, the man whom the Tondo road made a soldier,
Caloocan a patriot, and Yang-Tsun a Christian, has found
in the conquest of the soil a life of usefulness and power.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_404' name='page_404'></a>404</span></p>
<p>And the father and mother, Asher and Virginia Aydelot,
who, through labor and loneliness and hopes long deferred,
won a desert to fruitfulness, a wilderness to beauty&mdash;these
two, in the zenith of their days, have proved their service
not in vain, for that they have also won the second generation
back to the kingdom whose scepter is the hoe.</p>
<p>Not in vain did the scout of half a century ago drive
back the savage Indian from the plains; not in vain did
Funston and his &#8220;Fighting Twentieth&#8221; wade the Tulijan
and swim the Marilao; not in vain did Chaffee&#8217;s army burst
the gates of Peking, nor Calvin Titus fling out Old Glory
above its frowning walls.</p>
<p>Behind the scout came a patient, brave-hearted band of
settlers who, against loneliness and distances and drouth
and prairie fire and plague and boom, slowly but gloriously
won the wilderness. Into the jungles of Luzon will go the
saw and spade and spelling book. Upon the Chinese
republic has a new light shined.</p>
<p>Not more to him who drives back the frontier than to
him who follows after and wins that wilderness with sword
re-shaped to a plowshare does the promise to Asher of
old stand evermore secure!</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so
shall thy strength be. The eternal God is thy refuge, and
underneath are the everlasting arms.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p><b>WINNING THE WILDERNESS</b></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p><i>Illustrated by J. N. Marchand</i></p>
</div>

<p>The latest book from Mrs. McCarter&#8217;s pen is pronounced by critics the
best work she has ever done. It is a tale of the soil, of winning the
land from wilderness to fruitfulness. The author has written into
it a great human story, an epic of the prairies. It is aptly called
&#8220;The Sunflower Book,&#8221; for this flower figures in the glowing romance
running through its pages&mdash;the golden flower that Kansas chose as
its emblem because its face is ever turned toward the light.</p>
<p><b>A MASTER&#8217;S DEGREE</b></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p><i>Illustrated in color by W. D. Goldbeck</i></p>
</div>

<p>Vivid in its portrayal of fascinating college life, the fine young men
and women do more than win victories in athletics and in the class-room&mdash;they
win out in the battle for character. Vigorous in its
practical idealism, this is a story to influence and inspire.</p>
<p><b>A WALL OF MEN</b></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p><i>Illustrated in color by J. N. Marchand</i></p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;With God Almighty backing us, we&#8217;ve got to stand up like a wall of
men,&#8221; said one of the Free-soilers, and so they stood, the defenders
of liberty and home, on the newly-settled prairie lands&mdash;where the
tragedy of the Civil War was keenly known. The heroic figure of John
Brown appears in the story, and, with all the warring and suffering,
young life with its wonderful love moves through the pages of this
powerful book.</p>
<p><b>THE PEACE OF THE SOLOMON VALLEY</b></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p><i>Frontispiece by Clara P. Wilson</i></p>
</div>

<p>In a breezy manner the story is told of a New York City man sending
his rheumatic son to Kansas for a six months&#8217; stay on the ranch of
an old Yale chum living in the Solomon Valley. The indignation and
expectations of the young man collapse in the face of the facts, and
he falls in love with the life of the Kansas farm&mdash;and with the
farmer&#8217;s daughter.</p>
<p><b>THE PRICE OF THE PRAIRIE</b></p>
<div class='ce'>
<p><i>Illustrated in color by J. N. Marchand</i></p>
</div>

<p>In this book Mrs. McCarter made her fame secure. It is a great
picture of a thrilling time, and a series of events of historic significance.
Its pages are redolent of the sweet air and wide landscapes;
the pictures come and go of idyllic childhood, of growing love, of
Indian danger, of jealousy, of massacre, and of the movement toward
the settled life of the plains. It is a poignant and winning record
of the price paid for the prairie home.</p>
